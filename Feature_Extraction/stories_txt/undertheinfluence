in
all
honesty
i'm
gonna
start
out
by
admitting
i
sometimes
lie
occasionally
i'll
include
a
lie
in
the
story
i'm
telling
if
i
think
it'll
make
the
story
better
i
don't
do
it
to
protect
the
innocent
because
i
don't
know
any
stories
where
the
people
in
them
are
innocent
and
i
don't
do
it
to
be
shocking
either
though
i
admit
to
to
once
telling
a
story
where
i
exaggerated
the
length
of
my
penis
in
my
own
defense
i
exaggerated
down
and
not
up
and
i
did
it
for
the
laughs
you
the
story
i'm
telling
you
tonight
does
not
have
a
lie
in
it
or
many
laughs
for
that
matter
when
i'm
done
telling
you
this
story
you
may
think
it's
nothing
but
a
lie
but
i'd
ask
you
to
trust
me
on
this
at
the
age
of
nineteen
i
fell
prey
to
a
powerful
and
deeply
corrupting
influence
it
dogged
me
for
six
years
costing
me
many
a
friend
and
in
process
bringing
my
family
to
ruin
it
crippled
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
have
spent
the
intervening
fifteen
years
recovering
from
it
the
influence
i
speak
of
is
hope
now
you
should
know
at
the
get
go
there's
nothing
in
my
childhood
to
suggest
i
might
find
myself
on
such
a
wayward
path
as
that
my
parents
loved
me
terribly
they
taught
me
right
from
wrong
they
taught
me
to
be
courageous
in
the
face
of
bullies
they
taught
me
patience
and
forgiveness
they
taught
me
that
love
would
see
you
through
any
misfortune
my
trouble
began
on
independence
day
not
the
independence
day
but
my
independence
day
my
independence
day
occurred
on
memorial
day
nineteen
eighty
two
that
was
the
day
i
told
my
family
i
was
gay
the
act
itself
mom
dad
i'm
gay
was
relatively
unexceptional
in
fact
it
should
have
been
more
exceptional
and
i've
always
sort
of
wished
that
it
had
been
however
subsequent
events
overshadowed
it
and
it
pales
by
comparison
the
subsequent
events
occurred
in
my
absence
after
the
fact
as
i
was
in
my
car
driving
back
to
college
to
take
my
final
freshman
exams
i
remember
being
on
the
highway
and
thinking
how
you
know
i
kind
of
expected
my
parents
to
freak
out
a
little
and
you
know
to
my
surprise
they
had
not
freaked
out
they'd
been
calm
and
cool
and
collected
oddly
calm
cool
and
collected
but
still
i
was
really
happy
as
i
drove
back
to
school
meanwhile
subsequent
events
were
busy
unfolding
back
home
my
mother
was
going
through
the
house
where
i
grew
up
and
was
gathering
together
things
i'd
made
for
her
um
a
jewelry
box
when
i
was
in
four
h
and
a
painting
when
i
was
sixteen
um
a
box
of
letters
con
or
a
box
containing
the
letters
that
i'd
written
them
from
school
which
i
used
to
do
every
week
she
was
removing
photographs
from
the
walls
and
placing
them
in
little
piles
around
the
house
and
she
was
directing
my
father
who
never
dared
not
follow
her
direction
to
take
the
bed
and
the
desk
and
the
chair
and
the
lamp
and
the
smith
corona
my
smith
corona
even
and
to
put
them
all
in
the
front
yard
next
to
the
rock
garden
not
too
close
to
the
maple
tree
my
clothes
my
books
my
bookcases
my
report
cards
my
farah
fawcett
posters
my
shoes
three
years
worth
of
interview
magazines
the
good
ones
with
the
andy
warhol
covers
everything
then
with
my
brother
and
my
sister
and
my
grandparents
watching
my
mother
removed
a
cigarette
from
this
tiny
crocheted
case
she
always
kept
them
in
and
she
lit
the
cigarette
and
then
she
took
the
match
and
put
it
to
the
pile
of
things
there
in
the
front
yard
that
contained
the
soul
and
complete
record
of
my
existence
in
my
family
it
burned
for
seven
and
a
half
hours
thanks
in
part
to
the
addition
of
some
lighter
fluid
to
help
get
the
larger
pieces
of
furniture
going
all
of
it
all
that
was
me
prior
to
that
memorable
memorial
day
up
in
flames
according
to
my
sister
who
years
later
recounted
these
details
to
me
it
was
a
mighty
impressive
blaze
{cg}
in
their
eagerness
to
feed
it
and
due
to
an
unexpected
wind
off
the
fields
around
the
house
the
sugar
maple
that
was
older
than
my
great
grandfather
caught
a
spark
in
its
branches
and
was
sacrificed
they
cut
off
all
communication
with
me
they
emptied
and
closed
our
joint
bank
account
there
goes
college
they
barred
the
door
they
stopped
talking
stopped
answering
my
letters
stopped
taking
my
calls
they
stopped
anything
with
me
they
just
stopped
i
was
completely
disbelieving
i
mean
this
didn't
make
any
sense
uh
all
of
my
friends
had
you
know
stories
about
telling
their
families
they
were
gay
and
they
all
ended
the
same
way
sooner
or
later
everything
worked
out
fine
so
i
even
had
a
friend
named
neil
whose
parents
had
done
the
same
thing
you
know
at
first
they
just
stopped
talking
to
him
but
one
year
later
they
were
inviting
his
new
boyfriend
to
come
home
with
him
for
the
holidays
everyone
counseled
me
to
have
a
little
patience
and
have
a
little
hope
and
this
is
how
it
starts
slowly
just
a
little
hope
just
enough
to
get
you
through
but
hope
is
cumulative
a
little
bit
here
and
a
little
bit
there
it
builds
up
in
the
system
until
it
becomes
something
toxic
denial
i
mean
their
reaction
had
been
yes
extreme
but
not
the
worst
that
could
happen
the
thing
to
do
was
to
be
a
good
son
to
make
them
proud
to
earn
back
their
love
so
i
got
a
job
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
three
shifts
three
restaurants
six
days
a
week
that
would
show
them
but
they
weren't
watching
i
wrote
them
letters
lots
of
letters
about
nothing
you
know
it's
uh
tuesday
and
it's
hot
or
my
new
roommate
is
named
kathy
or
my
friends
took
me
out
for
my
birthday
yesterday
they
didn't
write
back
living
for
me
sort
of
came
to
a
halt
um
despite
the
fact
that
my
life
just
went
on
and
on
i
didn't
think
about
my
future
i
didn't
think
about
my
needs
i
didn't
think
about
my
sadness
i
didn't
think
about
any
of
it
i
didn't
have
to
because
i
had
hope
everyday
whispering
in
my
ear
don't
give
up
don't
walk
away
you're
almost
there
don't
stop
don't
grow
don't
develop
don't
don't
worry
just
don't
make
any
sudden
movements
or
you'll
blow
it
{sl}
uh
so
six
years
went
on
like
this
without
a
word
from
them
so
finally
hurt
and
confused
beyond
my
ability
to
hold
it
in
and
frankly
finding
it
really
difficult
to
maintain
the
illusion
that
this
was
temporary
i
decided
to
kind
of
make
one
more
attempt
to
force
the
issue
so
i
i
flew
home
and
showed
up
unannounced
at
my
mother's
office
it
was
an
amazing
visit
excuse
me
{sl}
i
asked
the
receptionist
to
to
page
my
mother
and
tell
her
she
had
a
surprise
visitor
and
i
stood
there
in
the
lobby
{cg}
and
i
remember
seeing
my
mother
come
down
this
long
hallway
toward
me
and
she
was
walking
and
then
she
sort
of
looked
up
and
she
saw
me
and
then
she
recognized
who
it
was
and
she
turned
and
walked
away
again
it
was
a
really
amazing
ninety
second
visit
two
and
a
half
weeks
later
a
black
funeral
wreath
was
delivered
to
me
at
my
office
with
a
note
that
said
in
memory
of
our
son
clearly
it
was
time
to
give
up
hope
and
take
up
therapy
so
i
uh
i
talked
to
a
counselor
who
asked
me
why
i
had
invited
this
turmoil
into
my
life
i
uh
i
talked
to
a
minister
who
suggested
a
christian
youth
camp
i
i
talked
to
a
lesbian
who
offered
to
slash
my
mother's
tires
if
i'd
pay
for
her
flight
there
i
signed
up
for
scream
therapy
where
i
beat
pillows
with
tennis
rackets
and
screamed
obscenities
and
you
know
pulled
a
muscle
in
my
shoulder
mostly
i
talked
to
friends
and
mostly
the
pain
persisted
the
sheer
weight
of
it
nearly
crushed
me
or
at
least
that's
how
it
felt
at
the
time
since
it
was
my
constant
companion
i
spent
most
of
my
time
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
fingering
it
like
some
sort
of
psychological
worry
stone
over
the
years
it's
been
eroded
by
so
much
handling
all
that
remains
now
is
a
small
hard
nearly
weightless
pebble
really
worn
away
is
most
of
the
anger
and
much
of
the
hurt
but
one
question
remains
how
was
it
possible
that
they
taught
me
love
and
loyalty
in
excess
of
that
which
they
themselves
possessed
i
have
come
to
believe
that
it's
not
possible
to
understand
what
they
did
not
possible
for
me
anyway
to
understand
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
some
justification
for
it
and
i
know
for
certain
that
there
is
not
still
there's
no
escaping
my
parents
this
um
this
thing
they
did
this
extreme
and
unfathomable
and
many
layered
thing
they
did
tore
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
my
life
i
have
spent
years
and
a
lot
of
money
darning
that
hole
while
trying
to
keep
the
rest
of
my
world
from
unraveling
and
yet
their
influence
on
me
is
enduring
my
parents
loved
me
terribly
i
have
been
courageous
in
the
face
of
bullies
there
is
such
a
thing
as
too
much
patience
but
no
such
thing
as
too
much
forgiveness
and
love
has
seen
me
through
every
misfortune
thank
you
