there're
some
scientists
who
say
that
the
universe
that
we
inhabit
is
not
the
only
universe
there
is
there
are
alternate
universes
they
say
that
these
universes
arise
from
the
sub
atomic
realm
of
quantum
physics
here's
how
they
say
it
works
every
time
a
quantum
event
happens
it
produces
all
of
its
possible
results
this
is
like
saying
if
you
flip
a
coin
it
comes
up
heads
but
it
also
comes
up
tails
since
those
two
results
are
mutually
exclusive
the
flipping
of
the
coin
splits
the
universe
into
two
alternate
universes
the
heads
universe
and
the
tails
universe
and
since
quantum
events
are
happening
all
the
time
it
means
that
alternate
universes
are
bubbling
up
continually
they're
always
being
created
splitting
off
from
ours
and
these
alternate
universes
are
real
they're
not
just
figments
of
the
imagination
they're
complete
whole
real
things
i
know
this
is
true
because
i
experienced
an
alternate
universe
i
was
driving
in
my
volkswagen
van
up
to
a
tai
chi
camp
in
upstate
new
york
a
couple
of
summers
ago
um
i
bought
the
volkswagen
van
when
i'd
quit
my
job
a
few
years
previously
i
bought
the
van
um
because
i
quit
the
job
as
a
custom
database
application
engineer
this
was
not
a
job
that
i
really
had
intended
to
become
when
i
was
a
kid
that's
not
what
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
uh
it's
just
sort
of
the
job
i
happened
into
and
i
always
thought
of
it
as
the
work
i
was
doing
before
i
was
gonna
find
my
real
work
but
when
i
got
close
to
about
forty
i
suddenly
thought
oh
my
god
this
could
be
it
this
could
be
what
i
end
up
doing
this
could
be
on
my
tombstone
tom
wiser
custom
database
application
engineer
wrote
well
optimized
queries
many
customers
satisfied
and
i
thought
no
that
that
can't
be
it
that
can't
be
all
there
is
and
i
quit
the
job
without
really
knowing
what
i
was
going
to
do
next
and
and
and
i
knew
that
what
i
should
do
was
to
take
my
skill
set
and
to
make
a
lateral
move
to
a
career
path
that
was
more
appropriate
but
but
i
i
i
really
didn't
wanna
do
that
i
didn't
wanna
be
so
logical
i
actually
wanted
something
more
magic
i
i
wanted
to
be
like
the
guy
in
the
fairy
tale
that
trades
the
cow
for
the
magic
beans
and
and
i
know
that
that's
a
bad
deal
i
know
that
the
cow's
a
better
investment
the
cow's
gonna
pay
off
in
the
long
term
but
but
but
but
if
the
magic
beans
work
out
you're
in
a
whole
new
story
so
so
so
i
quit
the
job
and
i
bought
a
volkswagen
pop
top
camper
van
and
i
drove
around
country
and
what
i
thought
is
ok
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
lateral
move
i
am
going
to
drive
around
the
country
and
i'm
gonna
open
myself
up
to
whatever
may
come
and
then
what
i'm
going
to
do
is
going
to
arise
organically
i'm
gonna
find
my
next
path
there
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
arizona
i'm
gonna
pick
it
up
and
bring
it
back
to
new
york
so
i
drove
around
the
country
twenty
five
thousand
miles
eight
months
and
when
i
got
back
to
new
york
i
had
no
clue
i
really
didn't
know
and
and
it
left
me
very
vulnerable
to
the
new
york
question
the
first
question
anybody
asks
which
is
so
what
do
you
do
i
didn't
know
i
had
i
had
a
i
didn't
have
a
good
answer
and
it
made
me
feel
really
embarrassed
because
everybody
knows
what
they
do
everybody
does
and
i
thought
i
should
too
so
when
i
was
driving
the
volkswagen
van
up
to
tai
chi
camp
the
other
summer
i
i
felt
very
relieved
because
in
camp
i
know
what
i
do
i
do
the
camp
thing
i
do
what's
at
camp
and
i
don't
know
if
you
know
this
but
there
are
a
lot
of
camps
for
adults
that
are
out
there
i
i
found
them
when
i
was
driving
around
the
country
uh
there
are
tai
chi
camps
and
yoga
camps
and
and
bird
watching
camps
there's
even
a
camp
where
you
can
dress
up
in
armor
and
joust
all
the
things
that
that
give
us
joy
and
that
we
tend
to
demean
with
the
name
hobby
those
are
the
things
that
are
that
are
celebrated
in
camp
and
when
people
go
to
camp
they
are
so
lit
up
they
are
finally
getting
to
do
that
thing
the
thing
they
love
it's
like
yes
i
finally
get
to
joust
i
don't
have
time
for
that
anymore
really
so
i
was
going
up
to
camp
and
feeling
pretty
good
about
it
and
i
decided
on
the
way
i
would
stop
into
ithaca
i
heard
that
it
was
a
a
kind
of
a
neat
town
so
i
i
pulled
off
the
highway
into
ithaca
and
um
it's
on
the
southern
shore
of
lake
cayuga
there's
flatland
and
these
hills
and
it
has
a
a
very
particular
microclimate
there
which
allows
hippies
to
survive
all
the
stores
have
names
like
it
takes
a
village
or
hemp
unlimited
and
and
and
the
and
the
children
are
all
completely
multiethnic
and
only
wear
cloth
organic
diapers
it
was
it
was
really
something
i
drove
around
like
sort
of
like
disney
hippie
land
just
watching
it
and
then
i
drove
up
the
hill
up
toward
cornell
which
has
these
stately
buildings
on
the
hilltop
and
and
as
i
drove
onto
the
campus
i
had
this
stabbing
sensation
and
i
suddenly
was
pierced
with
a
vision
of
an
alternate
universe
my
alternate
life
i
thought
oh
my
god
i
was
supposed
to
go
to
cornell
if
i
had
gone
to
cornell
i
woulda
studied
animal
behavior
and
right
now
i'd
be
a
professor
of
evolutionary
biology
i'm
a
professor
of
evolutionary
biology
and
i've
got
a
wife
she's
got
dark
hair
she's
really
smart
and
i'm
a
professor
with
a
wife
and
we've
got
two
kids
they
like
to
sing
it
was
this
completely
realized
vision
of
this
alternate
life
and
it
looked
so
good
alternate
ithaca
tom
he'd
made
these
great
choices
it
was
really
working
out
and
and
i
drove
around
in
a
in
a
kind
of
a
wash
of
nostalgia
for
this
life
that
i
hadn't
had
wow
there's
the
human
ecology
center
i
did
all
my
grad
work
there
and
there
was
this
funky
cottage
that
i
used
to
live
in
when
i
had
six
roommates
and
we
had
a
chore
wheel
and
ate
brown
rice
and
and
there
was
these
gorges
that
we
used
to
do
drum
circles
in
and
songs
to
the
goddess
and
it
was
and
and
there
was
this
woman
that
looked
just
like
my
wife
would
have
looked
when
i
would
have
met
her
i
was
overwhelmed
by
it
i
couldn't
stand
to
stay
there
any
longer
i
i
drove
off
the
campus
i
fled
ithaca
and
and
flew
to
tai
chi
camp
but
alternate
ithaca
tom
came
with
me
now
now
at
camps
i
tend
to
uh
really
b
have
a
good
time
i
i
laugh
a
lot
i
joke
a
lot
especially
in
tai
chi
camp
with
the
residents
are
kind
of
serious
and
slow
moving
uh
i
i
can't
help
but
kinda
tease
them
and
and
in
this
particular
camp
uh
the
teacher
said
that
we
were
going
to
be
meditating
every
morning
from
seven
to
eight
and
she
was
looking
for
a
volunteer
someone
a
musician
that
would
wander
the
hallways
um
playing
an
instrument
or
singing
to
wake
up
the
residents
uh
i'm
not
a
morning
person
and
so
i
thought
oh
so
i
have
a
choice
here
either
it's
gonna
be
six
thirty
i'll
be
lying
in
my
bed
really
grumpy
while
some
asshole
sings
outside
my
door
or
i
could
be
the
singing
asshole
for
the
rest
of
that
week
i
was
the
singing
asshole
of
the
camp
every
morning
i
would
i
would
roam
the
halls
singing
lustily
waiting
waking
up
all
of
my
fellow
tai
chi
players
and
i
and
and
the
the
people
there
saw
me
laughing
and
singing
and
they
said
tom
it's
really
great
to
have
you
here
you're
so
happy
you're
such
a
happy
guy
and
i
thought
yeah
you
think
i'm
happy
but
you
haven't
seen
alternate
ithaca
tom
i've
seen
him
he's
happy
and
and
the
fact
that
he
was
so
much
happier
than
me
was
making
me
miserable
and
i
kept
looking
at
everybody
else's
life
and
and
comparing
myself
to
them
and
i
remember
having
lunch
with
a
a
woman
who
was
in
her
sixties
and
she
was
a
calligrapher
and
she
was
about
to
have
her
first
grandchild
she
was
really
excited
and
i
thought
maybe
calligraphy
that
that
could
be
it
and
and
then
there
was
this
other
guy
he
had
studied
tai
chi
when
he
was
in
his
twenties
and
now
he
was
a
sales
rep
at
dell
and
i
thought
dammit
if
i
had
studied
tai
chi
in
my
twenties
maybe
i
could
be
a
sales
rep
at
dell
now
i've
never
wanted
to
be
a
sales
rep
but
i
was
i
was
just
getting
carried
away
that
feeling
that
i
was
in
the
wrong
life
i
was
in
the
wrong
place
i
couldn't
shake
it
i
i
really
tried
to
absorb
the
lesson
of
tai
chi
which
is
to
be
present
just
relax
accept
what's
coming
to
you
and
be
present
here
but
i
thought
yeah
yeah
that
would
be
easy
it's
so
much
easier
to
accept
where
you
are
if
only
you're
in
the
right
place
well
eventually
camp
was
over
and
i
i
left
i
drove
back
to
new
york
and
as
i
was
driving
over
the
george
washington
bridge
i
could
still
hear
alternate
ithaca
tom
he
was
hanging
around
me
haunting
me
like
a
ghost
and
i
thought
oh
god
i
need
professional
help
so
i
made
an
appointment
with
the
family
psychic
this
is
the
guy
that's
done
readings
for
all
of
my
siblings
and
my
cousins
and
i
went
to
see
him
and
he's
an
astrologer
so
he
did
out
my
chart
and
this
time
he
was
very
interested
in
this
polarity
that
he
saw
he
said
you
have
saturn
in
the
midheaven
and
this
marks
you
as
a
person
who
could
be
very
organizational
the
organizational
man
the
hierarchical
one
uh
the
corporate
guy
the
dad
the
provider
not
particularly
sexy
but
a
straight
up
guy
on
the
other
hand
there's
pisces
and
the
sun
and
they
they're
they're
uh
they're
squared
with
each
other
you
can't
resolve
them
pisces
and
the
dreamer
the
mystic
the
guy
that's
the
artist
never
quite
pinned
down
never
quite
in
a
relationship
and
and
you
have
to
balance
these
two
you
you
have
to
chose
one
or
the
other
and
and
and
normally
i
love
to
hear
this
kind
of
thing
this
is
the
great
thing
about
going
to
a
psychic
is
that
for
an
hour
they
just
talk
about
me
its
its
so
interesting
but
this
time
i
was
so
caught
up
with
alternate
ithaca
tom
i
couldn't
really
appreciate
it
all
so
i
i
just
blurted
out
what
had
happened
to
me
and
i
asked
him
what
does
this
mean
and
the
psychic
said
wow
this
represents
a
fundamental
choice
that
you've
made
in
your
life
you
could
have
been
the
hierarchical
guy
but
you
chose
to
be
the
piscean
if
you
had
decided
to
be
an
academic
you
would
have
been
very
successful
there's
no
doubt
that
the
university
structure
would
have
raised
you
up
you
probably
would
be
married
have
kids
i
thought
aw
shit
alternate
ithaca
tom
made
the
right
choices
but
the
psychic
said
if
you
