where
i
grew
up
in
the
south
there
was
a
right
way
to
do
things
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
things
and
the
right
way
was
to
do
what
your
family
and
society
thought
you
should
do
and
the
wrong
way
was
to
do
something
different
by
age
thirty
i
had
done
most
everything
i
was
supposed
to
do
i'd
overachieved
in
high
school
i
attended
a
prestigious
college
in
the
south
i
had
a
good
job
and
i'd
married
well
within
the
child
bearing
age
we'd
married
at
my
insistence
of
course
but
neither
one
of
us
was
fully
on
board
so
except
for
moving
up
north
to
boston
which
caused
my
family
to
collectively
take
to
their
beds
i
was
on
track
with
what
we
thought
my
life
should
look
like
but
i
wasn't
happy
and
i
thought
it
was
my
career
{ls)
in
my
family
i
was
expected
to
go
into
business
i
had
been
in
public
relations
for
seven
years
but
i
didn't
like
the
work
anymore
i
mean
i
was
good
at
it
but
i
was
tired
of
working
with
clients
and
plus
i
was
working
with
companies
like
retail
banking
traffic
reporting
hazardous
waste
recycling
nothing
that
really
blew
my
skirt
up
so
i
quit
my
full
time
job
and
i
started
consulting
and
i
started
taking
classes
to
figure
out
what
else
i
could
do
for
a
living
now
the
only
criterion
for
the
classes
was
that
the
instructors
and
students
could
not
know
or
care
what
the
financial
times
was
i
took
needlepoint
directing
french
i
found
this
brochure
for
the
school
of
the
museum
of
fine
arts
in
boston
and
i
thought
oh
well
this
looks
interesting
and
i
went
to
the
school
and
i
talked
to
the
continuing
education
director
and
i
asked
him
which
class
he
thought
i
should
take
and
he
said
you
need
to
take
art
as
process
we
take
burned
out
executives
in
that
class
all
the
time
i
sign
up
it's
my
first
day
of
art
school
i
do
my
best
to
look
artsy
to
fit
in
but
even
though
i
am
not
wearing
pearls
they
are
still
emblazoned
on
my
chest
and
our
instructor
rhoda
introduces
herself
and
she
says
there
is
no
right
way
to
make
art
and
there
is
no
wrong
way
to
make
art
now
this
makes
me
extremely
nervous
because
i
have
been
raised
that
there
is
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
most
everything
and
then
she
says
the
class
will
focus
on
process
the
process
of
art
making
not
the
end
result
now
this
makes
me
even
more
nervous
because
i
have
been
raised
to
focus
on
results
and
not
just
any
results
but
the
best
results
and
there
are
no
grades
things
careen
out
of
control
if
there
are
no
grades
how
will
i
know
if
i'm
overachieving
i
need
to
know
that
i'm
overachieving
we
start
with
the
basics
and
in
my
entire
life
i
had
never
held
a
stick
of
charcoal
in
my
hand
and
it
feels
good
and
i
survived
the
first
week
of
simple
art
exercises
and
i'm
enjoying
myself
and
the
next
week
bob
one
of
the
three
instructors
says
today
we're
gonna
do
gesture
drawings
very
fast
drawings
about
forty
five
second
poses
and
we're
going
to
draw
the
energy
and
the
movement
and
the
essence
of
the
figure
and
i
am
thinking
what
the
heck
is
essence
and
how
the
heck
do
you
draw
it
and
a
man
the
artists
model
starts
to
undress
and
i
say
well
that's
okay
you've
seen
a
naked
man
before
you've
even
had
sex
with
a
naked
man
before
your
problem
is
you
don't
know
how
to
draw
this
naked
man's
essence
and
everybody
else
apparently
does
know
how
to
draw
his
essence
as
they're
all
busily
getting
out
their
easels
and
knowingly
getting
out
sheets
of
paper
and
charcoal
and
other
drawing
mediums
with
which
they
excel
and
i'm
just
standing
there
like
the
proverbial
deer
in
headlights
and
i
begin
to
watch
and
imitate
because
i
am
clueless
but
competitive
and
so
i
ask
judy
who
is
standing
next
to
me
and
also
a
mature
student
i
say
judy
what
are
these
supposed
to
look
like
because
of
course
i
think
there's
only
one
right
way
to
do
this
and
we're
all
gonna
draw
the
same
image
and
she
looks
at
me
bewildered
and
says
they're
all
going
to
look
different
i'm
paralyzed
what
is
mine
supposed
to
look
like
can't
i
just
do
a
slide
presentation
for
your
board
of
directors
maybe
conduct
a
communications
audit
assess
your
customer
service
capabilities
these
are
things
i
know
how
to
do
things
in
which
i
excel
and
i
like
to
excel
and
there
is
no
way
i'm
gonna
excel
drawing
this
naked
man's
essence
and
i'm
about
to
cry
and
then
the
competitive
side
of
me
kicks
in
and
says
well
just
snap
out
of
it
you
big
wimp
and
do
something
so
i
start
making
these
hopeless
stick
figures
every
forty
five
seconds
because
that's
how
fast
the
poses
are
every
forty
five
seconds
and
every
forty
five
seconds
i
feel
like
a
total
failure
which
is
a
lot
of
times
in
one
hour
it's
eighty
and
the
shame
is
enormous
and
i'm
mortified
at
how
inept
i
am
and
i'm
like
beating
myself
up
for
ever
trying
anything
different
for
even
attempting
anything
new
and
i'm
in
literal
physical
pain
i
am
so
far
out
of
my
comfort
level
i
mean
i
actually
hurt
and
i'm
about
to
cry
again
and
that's
when
bob
comes
over
and
shows
me
what
amazing
teachers
can
do
i
don't
even
know
what
he
says
all
i
know
is
he
talks
me
off
the
ledge
and
breaks
the
vice
grip
that
has
a
hold
of
me
and
i
start
to
draw
at
the
end
of
class
bob
picks
one
of
my
gesture
drawings
to
put
up
on
the
wall
with
a
bunch
of
other
student
drawings
so
we
can
discuss
them
no
one
laughs
at
me
or
my
drawing
it
actually
holds
its
own
i
have
drawn
a
naked
man
and
i
feel
like
i
can
do
anything
but
things
at
home
start
to
get
a
little
tricky
my
husband
is
an
art
director
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
married
him
i
loved
being
with
somebody
artsy
he
seemed
so
exotic
and
interesting
he
was
the
creative
one
and
i
was
the
business
one
but
when
i
started
going
to
art
school
all
the
roles
were
off
the
balance
of
power
completely
out
of
sync
so
class
continues
for
the
next
six
weeks
and
it's
an
emotional
roller
coaster
i
mean
my
thinking
is
shifting
and
breaking
apart
and
i
cry
every
day
and
my
final
assignment
is
a
wall
installation
which
is
a
term
i
didn't
know
existed
six
weeks
before
and
it
includes
these
three
wall
sculptures
these
sculptures
made
out
of
the
new
york
times
business
sections
and
the
wall
street
journal
all
painted
black
and
they're
bound
in
these
really
tight
boxes
and
each
piece
gets
progressively
more
undone
until
the
final
piece
explodes
and
bob
the
instructor
that
talked
me
off
the
ledge
sees
it
and
he
says
tricia
you
know
you
really
ought
to
apply
to
the
museum
school
well
this
thought
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
i
mean
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i'm
gonna
end
up
in
business
school
that
this
is
a
once
in
a
lifetime
event
i
go
back
to
my
normal
life
and
i'm
highly
suspicious
and
then
it
occurs
to
me
what's
happening
he's
hitting
on
me
i
have
no
artistic
talent
at
all
he's
just
flattering
me
until
he
can
get
lucky
and
this
theory
sticks
until
i
find
out
he's
been
in
a
committed
relationship
for
the
past
eighteen
years
with
his
boyfriend
so
then
i
start
thinking
of
other
reasons
why
they
may
want
me
to
apply
maybe
they
think
i
have
a
lot
of
money
and
i'll
be
a
big
donor
cause
i
was
working
at
harvard
business
school
at
the
time
or
maybe
they
think
i
know
people
who
will
be
big
donors
and
so
while
i'm
using
all
of
my
creative
energy
trying
to
imagine
why
i'm
not
creative
charles
one
of
the
instructors
comes
up
to
me
and
says
tricia
you
really
ought
to
apply
to
the
museum
school
i
mean
you
know
you're
an
artist
you're
one
of
us
panic
begins
to
set
in
and
i
enroll
in
art
school
as
a
part
time
student
but
i'm
still
consulting
and
i'm
both
excited
and
traumatized
because
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
am
not
following
the
rules
and
i
say
to
my
dear
friend
sarah
who's
also
a
southerner
i
say
sarah
i
am
so
afraid
of
being
different
than
everybody
else
and
she
says
oh
tricia
i'm
so
afraid
of
being
just
like
everybody
else
and
my
marriage
begins
to
explode
and
part
of
the
reason
is
i'm
not
supposed
to
excel
beyond
men
definitely
not
beyond
my
husband
but
i
have
places
i
wanted
to
go
and
he
just
wasn't
moving
fast
enough
i
kept
pushing
him
to
move
faster
so
i
could
move
forward
and
one
day
he
just
says
to
me
tricia
you
just
want
me
to
go
places
i
don't
wanna
go
at
art
school
since
we
don't
have
grades
we
have
review
boards
and
at
the
end
of
each
semester
we
put
up
all
the
work
we've
done
and
two
instructors
and
several
students
review
the
work
give
us
feedback
and
guide
us
on
our
creative
path
and
i'm
driving
to
my
review
board
in
the
jeep
i've
purchased
for
the
yet
to
be
conceived
children
i
assume
i'll
have
but
instead
it's
piled
high
with
artwork
and
at
my
review
board
one
of
the
students
writes
this
on
his
review
board
sheet
you
seem
to
be
a
little
frantic
very
perceptive
it
has
something
to
do
with
control
it's
okay
to
let
go
you're
expecting
this
to
be
black
or
white
but
the
process
won't
allow
that
you've
got
to
let
go
i'm
not
sure
if
he's
talking
about
my
artwork
or
my
marriage
my
husband
and
i
separate
and
a
dear
friend
of
mine
says
you
know
tricia
i
love
my
husband
and
i
love
my
children
but
i
never
thought
i
had
options
you
have
options
and
she's
right
because
even
though
my
life
is
blowing
apart
or
maybe
because
it
is
i
begin
to
really
find
my
voice
and
step
into
my
artwork
my
mother
sees
it
and
says
why
is
it
so
dark
why
aren't
there
any
heads
it's
getting
harder
and
harder
to
do
my
consulting
work
and
even
though
i'm
getting
paid
a
fire
hose
of
cash
i
know
that
if
i
do
this
work
for
much
longer
i'm
gonna
die
slowly
but
i'm
gonna
die
and
i
realize
i'm
not
just
in
the
wrong
job
or
the
wrong
marriage
i'm
in
the
wrong
life
i
don't
want
to
do
what
other
people
want
me
to
do
or
think
i
should
do
anymore
all
i
want
is
to
make
art
i'm
an
artist
and
the
week
we
separate
they
tear
down
my
family
home
of
twenty
five
years
and
my
jeep
gets
stolen
i
have
this
keychain
with
three
keys
on
it
one
to
the
house
i
don't
live
in
anymore
one
to
my
family
home
that's
been
torn
down
and
one
to
my
jeep
that's
been
stolen
god
is
banging
on
my
hood
so
i
toss
the
keys
head
to
art
school
and
join
my
tribe
