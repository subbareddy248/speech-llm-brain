so
a
lot
of
people
are
raised
with
a
religion
and
i'm
one
of
those
people
that
was
raised
with
two
there
was
our
official
religion
my
family
is
and
i
was
at
the
time
conservative
evangelical
christians
but
then
there
was
our
unofficial
faith
and
hope
we
had
in
mary
kay
cosmetics
um
many
of
the
women
in
my
family
had
been
mary
kay
beauty
consultants
since
i
was
a
child
and
i
loved
jesus
as
long
as
i
could
remember
but
that
mary
kay
thing
was
i
was
hoping
to
dodge
that
bullet
um
i
was
this
brainy
grunge
girl
from
boulder
county
i
wore
hemp
jewelry
and
clothes
from
the
salvation
army
i
had
moral
obliga
um
objections
to
wearing
make
up
and
when
i
got
a
scholarship
to
go
out
of
state
for
college
i
thought
i'd
made
my
big
escape
but
my
last
visit
home
i
listened
to
one
recruiting
tape
too
many
and
the
logic
and
reason
finally
got
to
me
and
i
signed
the
dotted
line
and
i
started
my
business
as
a
mary
kay
beauty
consultant
now
on
paper
the
business
plan
looks
foolproof
all
you're
supposed
to
need
is
to
have
one
friend
to
host
a
party
for
you
where
you
sell
skin
care
and
make
up
to
her
friends
then
you're
supposed
to
book
two
more
every
time
so
your
date
book
is
never
empty
but
i
could
never
book
two
more
i
used
the
script
i
thought
i
was
fun
to
be
with
i
don't
know
what
the
problem
was
but
luckily
for
me
there
was
like
a
hundred
other
ways
they
trained
us
to
get
bookings
and
one
of
these
ways
was
to
strike
up
seemingly
natural
conversations
with
perfect
strangers
and
we
had
{cg}
we
had
a
name
for
this
we
called
this
warm
chatter
and
i
thought
dammit
i
am
gonna
rock
this
i
am
gonna
be
the
queen
of
warm
chatter
so
what
i'm
about
to
tell
you
i
did
this
um
for
very
long
time
about
two
three
days
a
week
for
two
or
three
hours
a
day
i
would
get
dressed
up
in
my
business
suit
and
i'd
put
on
all
my
make
up
and
i'd
pack
my
bag
full
of
samples
and
i
would
drive
to
target
and
in
target
i
would
get
my
red
shopping
cart
and
i'd
pretend
i
was
shopping
for
items
but
really
i
was
just
hunting
for
women
i
was
um
i
was
looking
for
women
who
looked
cute
or
friendly
or
approachable
when
i
found
somebody
like
this
then
i
would
just
discreetly
follow
her
through
the
store
until
we
could
be
together
in
an
aisle
alone
and
then
i
would
appear 
to
just
be 
walking
by
normally
and
i
would
slow
down
and
in
the
most
casual
way
possible
i
would
say
these
words
that
i'd
rehearsed
a
hundred
million
times
i
would
say
excuse
me
can
i
ask
you
a
quick
question
i'm
jen
with
mary
kay
and
we
just
came
out
with
a
new
line
of
lip
glosses
and
i
need
some
women's
opinions
of
it
you
know
i
have
some
samples
here
in
my
bag
is
there
any
reason
why
you
wouldn't
want
to
take
one
home
and
try
it
and
this
part
was
really
important
we
were
trained
to
smile
and
nod
while
we
asked
the
question
it
has
to
do
with
nonverbal
communication
and
mirroring
it's
very
advanced
and
um
and
if
she
said
yes
i'd
give
her
the
sample
i'd
get
her
phone
number
when
i
called
her
back
later
to
thank
her
i
would
offer
her
a
complimentary
appointment
with
me
and
i
wouldn't
mention
that
all
my
appointments
were
complimentary
cause
it
just
didn't
seem
important
so
at
the
same
time
i
was
doing
this
for
my
career
my
husband
and
i
were
also
leading
helping
to
lead
programs
for
our
local
church
and
this
is
the
kind
of
church
that
was
trying
to
be
really
hip
and
modern
it
met
in
a
strip
mall
and
we
had
a
rock
band
a
rock
band
leading
worship
up
front
the
pastor
was
this
forty
something
british
guy
and
he
really
wanted
to
attract
twenty
somethings
so
we
were
a
hot
commodity
we
were
right
in
the
demographic
and
we
started
to
get
promoted
up
into
higher
and
higher
echelons
of
leadership
so
we
were
invited
to
the
leadership
team
meeting
and
then
the
core
leadership
team
meeting
and
i
still
remember
my
first
night
at
one
of
these
meetings
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
think
i'd
always
imagined
them
to
be
kind
of
soulful
events
and
i
was
really
dismayed
to
show
up
and
discover
it
was
this
really
tedious
conversation
about
branding
and
marketing
and
what
the
church's
next
advertising
campaign
was
going
to
be
so
it
didn't
take
too
long
before
these
two
worlds
the
church
and
mary
kay
started
to
look
more
and
more
similar
um
they
both
had
the
lure
in
mary
kay
it
was
giving
out
free
samples
but
at
the
church
we
were
having
free
events
to
try
and
get
people
in
the
doors
in
both
worlds
we
were
couching
everything
we
did
inside
a
conversation
about
service
so
mary
kay's
company
tagline
at
the
time
was
changing
women's
lives
which
if
you
think
about
it
isn't
that
different
from
saving
people's
souls
and
um
and
we
really
we
really
believed
it
we
really
thought
we
were
doing
this
even
though
nobody's
motives
are
that
pure
and
in
both
worlds
i
was
being
trained
all
the
time
to
listen
to
people
everywhere
i
went
for
whatever
was
missing
or
not
working
about
their
life
and
offer
what
we
had
as
the
solution
so
if
you
needed
time
or
money
or
flexibility
mary
kay
might
be
perfect
for
you
but
if
you're
struggling
with
your
marriage
or
you've
had
a
recent
loss
maybe
you're
questioning
the
meaning
of
life
call
me
crazy
but
have
you
considered
maybe
jesus
is
the
answer
and
soon
i
just
started
to
feel
like
a
twenty
four
hour
saleswoman
and
it
started
to
get
confusing
like
which
hat
i
was
wearing
at
which
time
until
one
day
i
was
in
target
with
my
little
red
cart
and
i
saw
this
lovely
looking
redhead
who
smiled
so
big
when
i
smiled
at
her
and
i
started
into
my
script
excuse
me
can
i
ask
you
a
quick
question
except
this
time
it
started
to
sound
kind
of
flat
like
those
pull
string
dolls
that
sound
kind
of
wonky
at
the
end
and
um
suddenly
i
was
just
thinking
does
she
need
mary
kay
or
does
she
need
jesus
does
she
need
mary
kay
or
does
she
need
jesus
and
i
don't
know
which
one
i
offered
her
but
she
said
no
because
i
was
acting
crazy
um
and
she
turned
and
walked
away
and
i
realized
the
problem
with
whenever
you
have
something
whether
it's
a
religion
or
business
or
anything
else
that
you
think
is
the
right
answer
for
everybody
through
that
lens
you
can't
help
but
look
at
everyone
in
the
world
as
if
they're
broken
and
need
to
be
fixed
and
i
didn't
want
to
do
that
anymore
so
i
put
my
cart
away
at
the
front
of
the
store
and
i
drove
home
the
next
night
was
my
weekly
success
meeting
and
the
director
was
up
front
telling
us
giving
us
all
the
information
about
the
new
lipstick
formula
and
the
changes
that
were
being
made
and
i
start
to
look
around
the
room
at
these
women
and
they
were
either
my
friends
who
i'd
like
recruited
into
it
or
my
relatives
who
had
recruited
me
into
it
and
i
was
thinking
about
how
devastating
it
would
be
when
i
quit
because
i
wasn't
just
rejecting
everything
they
stood
for
but
i
was
letting
down
my
friends
i'd
gotten
them
into
it
i
was
bailing
on
them
and
then
my
relatives
the
people
who'd
recruited
me
their
income
depended
on
me
their
income
their
status
all
of
our
fortunes
were
tied
in
together
and
i
thought
but
is
this
really
changing
women's
lives
the
way
i
hoped
it
would
and
the
director
started
passing
around
mirrors
and
lipstick
samples
for
us
to
try
it
ourselves
and
i
thought
no
i
don't
think
so
anymore
and
a
couple
days
later
was
the
church
leadership
meeting
and
the
pastor
was
telling
us
that
the
church's
new
mission
statement
needed
to
have
five
points
one
for
every
finger
on
the
hand
so
people
could
remember
it
and
i
started
looking
around
this
room
and
thinking
about
what
they
would
think
about
me
when
i
quit
they
would
think
i
was
backsliding
and
falling
off
the
wagon
but
it
was
even
worse
than
that
they
would
think
i
was
going
to
hell
that
my
children
were
going
to
hell
and
if
i
was
wrong
maybe
they
would
be
right
and
i
thought
but
is
this
really
saving
people's
souls
this
all
this
that
we're
doing
and
the
pastor
interrupted
to
say
that
all
five
points
needed
to
start
with
the
same
letter
and
i
thought
no
i
don't
think
so
anymore
and
so
that
was
when
i
stopped
trying
to
save
the
world
and
i
decided
to
save
myself
instead
from
this
life
i
didn't
want
anymore
and
it
it
really
cost
me
i
lost
my
identity
i
lost
belonging
i
lost
the
ability
to
ever
be
that
certain
or
righteous
about
anything
ever
again
and
if
you
can
imagine
what
it's
like
to
lose
a
faith
and
then
imagine
what
it's
like
to
lose
two
at
once
because
even
though
mary
kay
was
a
business
it
wasn't
just
that
it
was
a
way
i
thought
the
world
worked
the
way
i
thought
that
we
could
all
win
and
everybody
could
get
what
they
needed
it
was
really
devastating
i
felt
like
i
might
not
ever
be
able
to
trust
myself
again
the
last
piece
of
our
exit
strategy
was
our
move
to
new
york
we
were
going
to
get
geographic
distance
start
fresh
someplace
else
we
landed
in
brooklyn
in
a
neighborhood
called
park
slope
and
everywhere
we
went
people
were
either
trying
to
recruit
us
into
or
warn
us
against
joining
the
park
slope
food
coop
and
it
seems
so
unobjectionable
you
know
like
who
can
argue
against
cheap
organic
environmentally
friendly
food
community
run
and
part
of
me
was
really
tempted
because
i
thought
i
can
have
my
identity
back
everyone
will
know
i'm
a
good
person
and
i
can
belong
again
but
there
was
something
about
the
way
that
the
people
we
talked
to
were
just
so
convinced
it
was
the
right
thing
for
everybody
that
felt
creepily
familiar
and
i
thought
i
know
where
that
path
leads
so
when
one
particularly
zealous
friend
cornered
me
one
day
and
said
are
you
gonna
join
or
not
are
you
in
or
are
you
out
i
just
took
a
deep
breath
and
i
looked
her
in
the
eyes
and
i
said
sorry
i
don't
do
religions
anymore
thank
you
