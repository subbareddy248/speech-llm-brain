tom
waits
loved
the
novel
jt
leroy
had
written
called
sarah
he
wanted
to
do
an
interview
with
jt
leroy
for
vanity
fair
magazine
and
he
wanted
jt's
input
on
who
would
photograph
the
spread
cause
jt
leroy
was
notoriously
shy
one
of
the
reasons
why
jt
was
so
shy
was
cause
jt
didn't
have
a
body
jt
was
an
avatar
so
let
me
take
you
back
some
years
i
was
sixteen
seventeen
years
old
and
i
was
a
ward
of
the
state
in
a
group
home
in
new
york
city
eight
girls
one
bathroom
and
the
girls
had
all
had
stories
being
some
had
been
raped
stabbed
by
a
parent
sold
into
slavery
everyone
had
secrets
at
night
time
we
would
tell
our
secrets
and
you
couldn't
tell
and
i
was
the
one
they
would
come
to
and
would
tell
their
stories
and
if
you
asked
me
why
i
was
there
i
don't
know
all
the
intakes
dysfunctional
family
i
dropped
out
of
school
i
don't
know
{cg}
{cg}
so
i
was
always
interested
in
how
do
you
tell
and
there
was
this
movie
street
wise
it
was
a
documentary
by
mary
ellen
mark
about
homeless
kids
in
seattle
and
i
gathered
up
some
of
my
friends
my
best
friend
lauren
from
the
group
home
we
had
been
institutionalized
together
prior
to
the
group
home
and
we
went
and
saw
this
movie
and
we
saw
ourselves
on
the
screen
now
the
street
can
seduce
you
and
these
kids
were
getting
swallowed
and
we
knew
we
were
just
one
step
removed
and
when
we
left
the
movie
i
saw
how
people
looked
at
us
right
before
they
were
kind
of
scared
of
us
and
i
got
off
on
that
you
know
cause
we
had
street
all
over
us
but
after
the
movie
they
looked
at
us
with
this
kind
of
curious
compassion
and
suddenly
i
didn't
want
to
be
the
victim
in
the
movie
i
was
interested
in
how
do
you
make
that
bridge
so
people
suddenly
care
and
you're
curious
enough
to
maybe
care
how
do
you
do
that
and
in
the
group
home
everyone's
telling
their
stories
and
i
don't
even
know
how
to
tell
mine
i
don't
even
have
the
tools
to
tell
mine
and
i
would
go
to
buy
a
little
relief
to
a
street
corner
there
was
a
phone
booth
right
on
the
corner
and
i
would
remove
it
from
me
i'd
be
a
boy
and
i'd
call
hotlines
and
i'd
tell
them
all
the
stories
my
stories
my
pain
everyone's
stories
the
house
parent
who
survived
the
biafran
wars
and
would
say
to
me
laura
your
job
is
to
tell
our
stories
cause
in
the
group
home
my
job
was
i
was
the
translator
so
some
girls
having
some
problems
with
the
house
parent
they'd
come
to
me
and
i
would
translate
between
what
each
other
was
saying
again
if
you
asked
me
i
don't
know
all
i
knew
is
if
you
heard
what
my
story
was
my
deepest
belief
was
that
you
would
say
well
you
deserve
it
wheh
stih
you're
disgusting
you're
horrible
my
deepest
hope
was
that
you
wouldn't
but
i
never
ever
gave
you
the
chance
but
i
wanted
to
learn
the
tools
to
tell
cause
that's
the
bridge
and
i
won
a
scholarship
to
the
new
school
for
social
research
and
they
let
me
in
without
the
sats
i
said
i
can't
take
the
sats
my
last
grade
of
completion
is
sixth
and
they
let
me
in
with
a
with
an
essay
and
i'm
taking
every
writing
class
i
can
get
my
hands
on
and
i
wrote
this
piece
in
this
class
about
you
can
tell
a
kid
that's
not
gonna
survive
long
on
the
street
because
the
scars
run
this
way
and
the
kids
are
there
wrap
enwrapped
you
know
and
and
and
everyone's
looking
to
see
whose
exterior
matches
the
story
and
everyone's
looking
at
this
one
cool
guy
he's
all
raggedy
and
i'm
in
the
group
home
and
i'm
just
looking
i'm
looking
at
him
too
and
i
wanted
to
be
him
cause
he
matches
the
voice
and
i
don't
want
them
to
know
it's
me
cause
it's
going
to
ruin
it
i
wanted
to
be
him
and
then
when
they
leave
cause
they
don't
know
it
was
anonymous
reading
the
story
and
then
and
then
when
we
leave
i
hear
people
talking
about
wow
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way
i
didn't
know
that
about
this
scene
and
that
and
i'm
like
that's
what
i
want
how
do
you
get
people
to
see
what
they
never
what
they
never
saw
before
they
they
never
knew
before
i
keep
writing
but
never
as
myself
the
writing
gives
me
a
little
more
relief
i
start
writing
under
the
name
jeremy
which
becomes
jt
{cg}

for
me
i
buy
myself
another
day
everytime
i
can
find
a
way
to
tell
but
as
long
as
it's
not
coming
from
me
never
as
a
woman
so
when
i
got
asked
by
tom
waits
when
he
asked
jt
leroy
who
he
wants
to
photograph
mary
ellen
mark
my
sister
in
law
came
over
one
day
and
she
just
shaved
her
head
and
i'm
looking
at
her
and
she
looks
like
the
blonde
hair
blue
eyed
little
boys
that
i
would
see
in
the
after
school
specials
when
they
were
just
starting
to
talk
about
abuse
sexual
abuse
always
a
blonde
hair
blue
eyed
cute
little
boy
that
you
would
forgive
and
love
no
matter
what
they
did
no
matter
how
transgressive
and
bad
they
were
you
just
loved
them
i
i
never
saw
myself
represented
in
any
of
that
so
she
looked
{cg}
she
was
jt
and
she
agreed
to
be
my
avatar
now
mary
ellen
mark
said
that
the
person
she
was
photographing
did
not
feel
like
somebody
who
had
suffered
liked
someone
it
felt
like
someone
who
maybe
came
from
privilege
but
she
said
the
books
needed
to
be
in
the
world
that
the
books
showed
a
world
she
had
never
seen
that
she
wanted
the
books
to
be
out
there
and
she
photographed
the
avatar
{cg}
i
continued
to
publish
under
the
name
jt
leroy
i
wrote
the
book
sarah
which
was
received
with
great
acclaim
i
published
it
as
fiction
all
my
work
as

came
to
pass
that
this
book
that
explored
the
wilds
of
west
virginia
a
state
i
had
never
been
in
in
this
kind
of
magic
i
played
with
gender
and
identity
and
it's
the
spirit
everything
that
i
had
experienced
all
the
pain
all
the
suffering
the
joy
the
hope
the
holding
on
to
finding
that
a
possibility
of
being
saved
no
matter
what
the
spirit
the
humor
it
was
all
in
there
turned
upside
down
in
this
book
