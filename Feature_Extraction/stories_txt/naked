i
grew
up
in
a
really
small
town
in
alabama
and
my
sister
was
and
is
to
this
day
a
remarkably
beautiful
woman
and
i
was
always
really
good
in
school
so
it
fell
into
this
pattern
with
my
family
where
people
would
say
things
like
she's
the
beauty
you're
the
brain
and
among
my
almost
anorexically
petite
friends
growing
up
at
five
foot
five
a
hundred
and
forty
pounds
it
was
universally
acknowledged
that
i
was
the
fat
one
the
whole
thing
really
started
in
first
grade
i
have
to
say
there
was
a
weigh
in
in
school
my
best
friend
nan
coley
who
was
going
to
go
on
to
become
the
head
cheerleader
of
our
high
school
hopped
on
the
scale
and
weighed
forty
five
pounds
but
when
i
jumped
on
the
needle
cropped
uh
creeped
up
to
fifty
and
i
looked
over
and
i
could
see
nan
looking
at
me
in
horror
not
just
for
me
but
for
herself
and
she
suggested
right
then
and
there
that
i
go
on
a
diet
and
so
i
did
for
the
next
twenty
years
i
would
never
wear
a
bathing
suit
without
putting
a
t
shirt
over
it
first
i
would
never
change
at
a
sleep
over
party
without
getting
in
a
sleeping
bag
i
would
never
let
a
lover
see
me
naked
with
the
lights
on
and
not
once
did
i
ever
stand
in
front
of
my
closet
to
pick
out
an
outfit
with
any
other
intention
other
than
to
look
as
thin
as
possible
now
along
the
way
well
meaning
people
tried
to
help
but
just
made
things
worse
such
as
my
stepmother
the
baywatch
extra
who
decided
when
i
was
eleven
you
know
at

at
eleven
years
old
she
decided
to
give
me
a
makeover
but
the
result
was
something
like
if
you
put
blue
ah
sh
eyeshadow
and
frosty
pink
lipstick
on
a
cabbage
patch
kid
it
wasn't
good
but
somehow
i
managed
to
get
through
high
school
and
college
and
at
age
twenty
six
i
packed
up
my
baggage
and
moved
to
southern
california
where
surprisingly
i
actually
got
better
there
was
something
about
like
all
the
you
just
extreme
views
that
people
had
about
their
body
all
the
fake
everything
um
and
the
bleach
blonde
hair
that
made
me
kind
of
give
up
i
think
i
kinda
uh
i
think
i
kind
of
threw
in
the
towel
and
so
i
joined
the
gym
down
the
street
because
it
was
cheap
and
i
discovered
that
lifting
weights
could
be
actually
fun
because
you
would
get
strong
and
then
with
my
newfound
muscle
tone
i
put
on
shorts
for
the
first
time
ever
and
went
for
a
hike
which
led
to
a
run
and
then
when
food
was
no
longer
the
enemy
i
started
cooking
healthy
food
and
after
six
months
i
actually
lost
twenty
pounds
and
one
day
i
was
getting
dressed
to
go
out
and
i
actually
glanced
in
the
mirror
which
of
course
i
usually
avoided
and
um
i
realize
i
almost
didn't
recognize
myself
and
i
i
i
examine
myself
from
head
to
toe
standing
there
in
my
bra
and
panties
and
discover
that
actually
couldn't
lose
any
more
weight
and
i
actually
look
pretty
darn
good
now
around
the
same
time
my
boyfriend
was
back
in
boston
and
he
had
decided
to
produce
an
independent
film
and
he
was
begging
me
to
come
back
east
to
produce
the
film
for
him
but
in
order
to
do
that
i
calculated
that
i
was
gonna
have
to
raise
two
thousand
dollars
over
the
next
four
months
somehow
extra
which
my
eleven
dollar
an
hour
temp
job
really
wasn't
gonna
produce
so
i
went
out
and
got
a
copy
of
the
l
a
times
and
as
i
was
perusing
the
ads
for
like
you
know
chuck-e-cheese
night
manager
and
you
know
evening
legal
secretary
work
i
saw
an
ad
that
said
dancers
wanted
earn
up
to
five
hundred
dollars
a
night
now
you
have
to
understand
that
i
cannot
dance
i'm
somewhat
famous
ang
among
my
friends
for
having
tripped
over
my
own
feet
when
i
was
in
college
in
boston
and
actually
knocked
myself
unconscious
on
the
sidewalk
it's
true
so
i
ignored
it
and
went
to
the
other
ads
but
i
kept
coming
back
to
it
like
five
hundred
dollars
a
night
so
i
threw
down
the
newspaper
and
i
ran
to
my
room
and
like
in
in
examined
my
butt
carefully
in
the
mirror
like
could
it
be
that
my
butt
was
good
enough
and
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
made
an
appointment
with
a
woman
named
samantha
now
my
best
friend
steve
was
very
against
this
he's
like
catherine
your
newfound
self
esteem
has
been
too
long
coming
and
too
hard
won
for
you
to
risk
it
all
because
some
bitch
down
at
the
strip
club
doesn't
think
you're
good
enough
and
i
knew
he
was
right
but
i
somehow
couldn't
stop
i
just
had
to
see
so
the
next
day
i
put
on
my
sluttiest
outfit
and
made
my
hair
huge
and
put
on
like
all
the
make
up
i
owned
and
i
went
down
and
as
i
walked
into
the
club
the
most
beautiful
woman
i've
ever
seen
to
this
day
was
pulling
herself
upside
down
naked
up
a
pole
with
grace
and
i
was
like
what
am
i
doing
but
just
then
i
heard
someone
say
you
must
be
renee
now
renee
was
a
totally
insane
alcoholic
legal
secretary
that
i
worked
with
and
i
was
think
i
was
hoping
to
channel
her
so
i
picked
that
as
my
fake
name
and
i
said
yes
i'm
renee
and
i
thought
that
there
was
gonna
be
all
these
questions
and
i
had
to
memorize
this
detailed
like
personal
history
that
was
all
a
lie
but
she
just
took
one
look
at
me
and
said
when
can
you
start
so
while
i
wanted
to
what
in
my
head
i
was
thinking
like
no
way
um
i
was
like
uh
how
about
monday
and
she
said
ok
over
the
weekend
i
went
out
and
bought
a
brand
new
pair
of
silver
panties
and
a
silver
push
up
bra
and
these
really
amazing
silver
high
heels
now
my
steve
was
still
trying
to
talk
me
out
of
it
he
was
like
catherine
the
smarter
the
stripper
the
more
they
hate
stripping
what
are
you
gonna
do
when
some
asshole
comes
up
to
you
and
says
hey
you're
pretty
hot
do
you
want
to
give
me
a
blow
job
afterwards
in
the
parking
lot
you're
gonna
wanna
tell
him
to
fuck
off
but
what
you're
gonna
have
to
do
is
go
well
i'll
get
fired
if
i
do
that
but
i'll
be
fantasizing
about
it
the
entire
time
you're
on
sta
i
mean
i'm
on
stage
and
he
said
do
you
think
you
can
do
that
and
i
was
thinking
you
know
for
five
hundred
dollars
a
night
maybe
i
can
so
um
uh
so
uh
sah
so
uh
oh
insanely
that
monday
morning
i
actually
went
to
work
at
my
temp
job
and
so
at
five
o'clock
i
got
off
and
showed
up
at
the
club
wearing
my
temping
outfit
which
was
these
very
baggy
awful
black
pants
a
little
sailor
top
my
hair
you
know
very
straight
and
my
glasses
and
as
i
walked
in
i
was
told
to
go
over
and
tell
the
d.
j.
what
my
song
would
be
and
i
walked
over
i
was
like
hi
i'm
the
new
girl
i'll
be
dancing
to
alanis
morisette
and
he
was
just
like
alright
and
he
says
the
dressing
room's
over
there
and
i
looked
at
the
dressing
room
and
suddenly
i
realized
that
behind
that
dressing
room
were
probably
ten
drop
dead
gorgeous
women
and
i
was
like
oh
my
god
and
so
i
looked
at
the
door
and
i
looked
at
the
door
of
the
club
and
just
then
i
heard
hi
you
must
be
the
new
girl
i'm
chloe
and
i
turn
and
to
my
right
was
this
little
patricia
arquette
sort
of
knock
off
girl
and
she
was
wearing
stars
on
one
boob
and
spangle
on
the
other
and
one
of
these
seventies
style
bikinis
with
a
little
silver
skirt
and
she
was
adorable
um
she
was
like
hi
i'll
show
you
the
way
so
chloe
grabs
me
by
the
hand
drags
me
off
and
leads
me
into
the
dressing
room
and
i
start
getting
dressed
with
the
other
girls
and
actually
the
other
girls
were
pretty
nice
um
and
so
they
explained
to
me
the
rules
of
the
club
which
i
hadn't
known
before
um
in
the
first
place
the
first
s
song
you
did
you
know
in
your
bra
and
panties
and
little
whatever
you
wore
after
but
the
sec
and
they
were
like
the
the
only
the
second
song
is
topless
and
i
was
like
the
second
song
is
topless
i
think
i
think
the
whole
time
i'd
been
picturing
that
i'd
just
go
out
onstage
and
flit
around
a
little
at
the
very
end
i'd
drop
my
bra
and
run
but
no
you
had
to
be
topless
for
an
entire
song
and
i'm
like
oh
no
but
i
was
like
ok
and
like
they
were
all
looking
at
me
like
i
can't
back
out
so
like
i'm
taking
off
my
clothes
and
everybody's
just
naked
and
so
just
then
um
the
dj
who's
this
fo
you
know
three
hundred
pound
man
named
rudy
comes
into
the
room
and
he
says
um
and
he's
like
hey
girls
and
al
the
girls
are
kinda
like
aaaah
rudy
get
out
aaaah
and
like
i'm
naked
and
like
i
but
i
didn't
even
care
and
and
i
realized
at
the
time
i 
wa
that
maybe
i'd
gone
somewhere
that
i'd
never
been
before
mentally
and
maybe
i
was
gonna
get
through
this
night
um
so
rudy
leaves
and
um
i'm
starting
to
get
dressed
and
the
girls
go
no
you
can't
wear
those
silver
panties
you
have
to
wear
a
g
string
and
i
was
like
oh
no
i
don't
have
a
g
string
well
bye
bye
bye
um
but
janee
was
this
leggy
blonde
from
texas
whose
claim
to
fame
was
that
she
stripped
into
her
sixth
month
of
pregnancy
janee
says
hi

just
washed

borrow
this
and
she
throws
it
at
me
i'm
like

so
i'm
putting
on
a
strange
girl's
g
string
and
i

and
so
the
girls
um

hair
and
like

it
huge
and
they
put

and
like
fake
eyelashes
and
all
this
stuff
and
um
i
was
ready
to
go
and
as
i
walked
out
i
glanced
in
the
mirror
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
looked
unbelievable
so
thank

i
go
out
and
i
go

and
he
looks
at
me

like
holy
shit
box
all
that
was
under
there
and
i
was
like

then
um
chloe
starts
giving
me
a
tour
of
the

and
as

she's
doing
this
this
guy

incredible
dancer
and
she's
running
around
and
i'm
just
like
uh
oh
my
god
but
so
i
could
tell
chloe
i'm
like
you
know
i'm
really
a
little
nervous
and
she
goes
no
no
no
you'll
have
no
problem
she's
like
it's
not
the
best
dancers
that
make
all
the
money
it's
the
girls
who
can
really
connect
with
the
men
who
can
look
from
guy
to
guy
to
guy
and
make
the
guy
think
that
they're
only
looking
at
them
um
and
it's
really
not
being
about
a
dancer
they
just
want
to
see
you
nude
up
there
um
but
the
biggest
problem
you're
gonna
have
is
that
you're
gonna
get
bored
now
being
bored
was
not
something
that
occurred
to
me
as
it
was
going
to
be
a
problem
she's
like
no
you
know
there
i
have
a
special
trick
it's
called
the
drop
and
role
so
what
you
do
you
know
is
you
go
out
there
and
you
sort
of
like
slowly
slowly
slowly
slowly
lower
and
like
slowly
slowly
slowly
roll
around
she's
like
they'll
they'll
picture
you
rolling
around
in
their
beds
and
then
slowly
slowly
slowly
slowly
stand
back
up
and
if
you
do
it
slow
enough
it
could
take
up
like
two
minutes
and
i
was
like
great
um
so
i
go
out
and
um
so
then
chloe
has
to
do
her
song
and
i
go
and
i
sit
down
near
the
door
and
um
i
get
a
coke
to
drink
because
i
didn't
wanna
drink
alcohol
because
i
had
to
drive
home
like
i'm
such
a
nerd
and
so
i
sit
there
and
um
all
of
a
sudden
like
it
was
a
really
cold
night
and
um
the
wind
blew
in
and
i
got
really
cold
and
of
course
i
hadn't
eaten
for
like
three
days
cause
i
was
so
nervous
you
know
kind
of
like
today
and
um
so
i
was
like
i
started
to
freak
out
and
i
looked
up
and
i
was
just
like
what
what
am
i
doing
and
so
i
go
over
to
chloe
who's
come
off
stage
now
and
she's
sitting
next
to
um
mister
shot
in
the
leg
guy
like
they've
made
up
now
they're
friends
again
and
so
i
go
over
and
i'm
like
hi
you
know
i
was
like
you
have
been
so
great
and
thank
you
so
much
but
i
just
realized
that
i
can't
dance
so
i'm
gonna
go
home
and
practice
and
i'm
gonna
come
back
and
chloe
looked
at
me
uh
right
in
the
eyes
and
she
said
if
you
walk
out
of
that
door
right
now
you
will
never
come
back
and
you
will
regret
it
for
the
rest
of
your
life
and
i
knew
that
she
was
right
and
just
then
mister
shot
in
the
leg
guy
reaches
out
like
under
the
little
dress
i'm
wearing
and
grabs
my
bare
ass
and
you
know
sort
squeezes
it
and
he
slaps
me
in
the
ass
and
he
says
you
know
this
is
the
worst
you
feel
this
this
is
the
worst
thing
that's
gonna
happen
to
you
all
night
and
he
smacks
me
he
goes
now
get
up
on
that
stage
and
i
was
like
alright
and
so
so
i
went
out
onstage
and
you
know
so
i
went
out
and
i
walked
over
and
there
was
a
pole
and
so
i
sort
of
swung
around
the
pole
and
like
chloe's
running
around
getting
everyone
to
yell
and
scream
a
very
supportive
friend
and
um
so
like
i'm
running
around
and
um
but
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
insanely
i
run
out
of
things
to
do
and
i'm
like
oh
the
drop
and
roll
so
i'm
like
lower
lower
lower
lower
lower
roll
roll
roll
and
as
i'm
rolling
around
i
feel
something
hit
my
cheek
and
i'm
like
oh
my
god
i'm
so
bad
they're
throwing
napkins
at
me
and
but
i
turn
my
head
to
the
right
onstage
and
i
open
my
eyes
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
dollar
bill
and
i
was
like
oh
and
so
then
i'm
like
leans
off
like
this
and
i
see
standing
above
me
is
mister
shot
in
the
you
know
gang
fight
man
and
he's
standing
over
me
with
a
roll
of
ones
pulling
them
off
and
dropping
them
down
on
top
of
me
and
all
i
could
think
was
i
swear
to
god
was
what
would
my
ophthavolg
ba
ophthalmologist
father
back
in
alabama
think
if
he
could
see
me
right
now
so
um
but
then
like
everyone
was
throwing
money
and
it
was
amazing
and
so
i
got
up
and
then
it
came
to
finally
be
the
dreaded
topless
song
so
i
went
to
the
special
topless
part
of
the
stage
and
the
song
started
and
um
i
unhooked
my
bra
very
slowly
and
slowly
the
strap
and
slowly
the
strap
and
then
i
let
the
bra
drop
to
the
floor
and
i
stood
there
in
front
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
people
wearing
only
a
g
string
the
whole
crowd
went
nuts
and
i
have
to
say
it
was
one
of
the
most
amazing
moments
of
my
entire
life
um
no
one
in
that
club
gave
a
shit
what
i'd
made
on
my
s.a.t.
no
one
cared
that
i
was
a
straight
a
student
no
one
cared
that
i
was
in
the
gifted
class
when
i
was
eight
they
just
wanted
to
see
me
nude
it
was
so
cool
i
never
went
back
to
the
club
after
that
night
in
the
first
place
security
was
pretty
lax
um
chloe
kept
making
like
s
like
little
passing
remarks
ok
chloe
chloe
kept
making
remarks
about
how
only
a
few
of
our
friends
have
been
killed
by
customers
which
i
found
disconcerting
um
but
the
worst
part
was
ah
the
next
day
at
work
walking
across
the
sony
lot
i
suddenly
was
examining
every
strange
man
that
passed
me
i
was
noticing
them
and
checking
them
out
and
um
i've
always
been
one
of
the
and
they
and
they
seemed
kind
of
yucky
to
me
um
i
was
sort
of
it's
like
every
man
was
suddenly
a
customer
i've
always
been
one
of
those
women
that
really
loves
men
and
i
thought
if
this
is
what
i'm
like
after
three
hours
what
am
i
gonna
be
like
after
three
months
or
three
years
um
but
several
good
things
came
out
of
it
in
the
first
place
one
of
the
customers
taught
me
this
really
cool
trick
which
is
if
a
guy's
pawing
you
you
hold
his
hand
cause
he
thinks
you're
holding
his
hand
but
what
you're
doing
is
you're
holding
his
hand
off
of
you
uh
this
came
in
super
handy
the
next
summer
in
my
ba
uh
career
as
a
film
producer
um
but
the
best
thing
of
all
is
that
to
this
day
any
time
i'm
having
a
fat
day
or
i've
just
broken
up
with
someone
or
i'm
just
feeling
a
little
down
about
myself
all
i
have
to
do
is
open
the
door
and
peek
into
the
back
of
the
closet
where
i
still
keep
those
silver
high
heels
and
i
know
in
my
heart
that
everything
is
gonna
be
ok
thank
you
