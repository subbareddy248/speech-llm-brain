so
about
a
month
into
my
daughter's
kindergarten
career
beginning
of
her
being
in
school
i
was
informed
by
her
mother
that
her
teacher
was
concerned
about
uh
how
she
was
doing
and
a
month
into
kindergarten
you
would
think
that
there's
not
a
whole
lot
that
you
need
to
know
ha
how
to
do
but
apparently

my
daughter
was
was
giving
her
teacher
cause
for
concern
and
so
at
at
the
earliest
opportunity
which
was
the
parental
uh
observation
day
around
halloween
i
went
in
to
observe
the
class
and
uh
it
was
all
very
familiar
and
i
it
was
clear
to
me
what
her
teacher
meant
even
though
it
had
been
delivered
to
me
in
a
really
ambiguous
and
and
hard
to
understand
way
i
i
watched
my
daughter
just
be
herself
uh
in
this
classroom
kind
of
blissfully
unaware
of
of
what
was
expected
of
her
um
it
seems
all
very
innocent
kindergarten
and
everything
but
that's
where
they
start
training
you
how
to
be
a
part
of
society
which
if
you're
into
that
kind
of
thing
that's
awesome
um
but
you
don't
have
much
much
choice
though
in
this
world
but
so
i'm
watching
her
and
watching
her
like
do
her
thing
and
watching
her
teacher
get
frustrated
with
her
to
the
point
of
like
near
anger
just
because
she's
not
jumping
to
the
next
uh
thing
that's
being
assigned
to
her
because
they
have
like
little
sections
in
the
day
or
in
the
afternoon
for
they
have
to
work
on
and
uh
it
was
very
familiar
uh
a
nice
thing
that
can
happen
with
having
children
is
that
you
can
see
yourself
and
you
can
be
reminded
of
of
of
the
progression
of
your
own
life
through
viewing
them
and
i
was
i
was
brought
back
to
my
experience
beginning
kindergarten
and
i
i
can
see
myself
very
clearly
and
my
daughter
we
share
a
lot
of
(br}
similarities
and
i
remember
being
handed
like
rudimentary
mathematics
that
you're
supposed
to
start
in
kindergarten
and
not
being
interested
at
all
so
not
even
bothering
uh
it
was
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
that
you
were
that
wa
it
was
like
required
uh
it
was
clear
to
me
that
she
was
kind
of
in
the
same
place
and
uh
her
teacher
besides
rubbing
me
the
wrong
way
you
know
in
a
in
a
lot
of
ways
clearly
didn't
understand
my
daughter
i
didn't
want
my
daughter
to
stay
in
that
school
i
wanted
her
out
um
and
that
could
be
just
it
it's
hard
to
say
when
you're
dealing
with
your
children
because
you
know
everyone
thinks
that
their
children
are
god's
gift
to
the
planet
you
know
or
sane
people
do
sane
people
do
um
so
i
i
wanted
her
out
i
didn't
think
it
was
g
it
was
a
good
place
for
her
but
i
i
didn't
think
anything
was
wrong
with
her
but
of
course
i
didn't
because
i'm
her
father
and
uh
it's
very
difficult
to
see
your
children
clearly
because
i
i
would
i
would
like
to
say
because
of
the
uh
incredible
amount
of
love
that
you
have
for
them
but
that's
not
totally
honest
because
there's
something
besides
the
love
there's
ego
involved
because
there's
such
reflection
of
you
you
want
them
to
do
good
you
want
them
to
be
smart
you
want
them
to
be
beautiful
because
you
i
mean
you're
smart
and
you're
beautiful
and
you
do
good
you
know
or
that's
how
you
wanna
perceive
yourself
in
this
world
and
you
want
your
children
your
offspring
to
t
to
to
have
that
that's
maybe
a
little
ugly
but
it's
true
and
i
think
it's
true
for
most
parents
um
so
i
do
love
my
daughter
a
great
deal
and
i
love
myself
and
i
wanted
wanted
her
outta
that
school
and
uh
her
mother
a
very
fine
woman
um
brilliant
a
and
beautiful
we're
partnered
in
raising
her
we're
not
partnered
romantically
didn't
wanna
uh
hear
me
that
that
maybe
that
the
teacher
had
the
problem
because
she
was
beginning
a
career
as
a
teacher
and
she
always
heard
parents
talk
about
how
how
it
was
the
teacher's
problem
and
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
actually
see
their
children
and
i
had
no
idea
how
hard
it
was
to
be
a
teacher
with
all
these
kids
and
blah
blah
blah
not
blah
blah
blah
i'm
sure
she
had
points
but
we
really
we're
very
very
good
at
disagreeing
we
can
disagree
very
strongly
but
i
can
see
myself
in
my
kid
and
i
i
can
see
myself
sitting
at
the
kindergarten
desk
that
she
was
sitting
at
i
can
see
the
similarities
and
a
lot
of
the
similarities
come
down
to
an
attribute
that
is
slowness
like
it
real
slowness
that
uh
we
share
that
has
been
like
uh
frustrating
to
teachers
and
parents
and
friends
and
lovers
and
roommates
and
any
number
of
people
um
for
instance
like
it
it
it
really
can
and
often
does
take
me
an
hour
to
put
on
my
shoes
and
i
i
can't
tell
you
where
the
time
goes
it's
not
like
i
got
distracted
and
started
playing
records
or
something
like
i
can
sit
in
the
same
place
putting
on
my
socks
and
shoes
for
an
hour
so
can
my
daughter
we
can
lose
weekends
just
sitting
on
the
toilet
and
uh
if
this
apartment
where
where
i
spent
time
with
my
daughter
there's
only
one
toilet
so
that
i'm
sta
that's
easy
for
me
to
see
the
similarities
you
know
um
uh
thinking
about
how
we
see
our
children
and
how
we
see
ourselves
and
our
children
and
how
we
want
to
see
ourselves
in
a
in
a
positive
light
we
don't
want
something
to
be
wrong
with
our
children
um
it
makes
me
think
about
a
moment
in
time
when
i
was
seventeen
years
old
and
i
was
watching
television
with
my
father
uh
episode
of
nova
uh
it's
like
a
science
program
that
was
on
i
think
it
was
on
pbs
i
don't
know
if
it
still
exists
um
this
one
was
on
neuroscience
and
neuro
neuroscience
technology
and
uh
they're
had
a
guy
getting
prepared
for
a
cat
scan
and
being
receiving
a
cat
scan
and
it
filled
me
with
this
crazy
wave
of
uh
of
like
deja
vu
but
not
just
regular
deja
vu
like
deja
vu
mixed
with
dread
and
like
sickness
to
my
stomach
and
i
it
was
overwhelming
and
i
couldn't
stop
thinking
about
it
and
wondering
if
like
did
i
have
a
cat
scan
so
i
turned
to
my
father
and
asked
him
if
i
had
a
cat
scan
he
said
no
and
fell
back
asleep
and
then
uh
i
couldn't
get
out
of
my
head
and
i
started
remembering
more
and
more
this
experience
of
being
a
little
kid
and
getting
a
cat
scan
and
uh
um
i
finally
went
to
my
mother
asked
her
and
she
didn't
wanna
talk
about
it
and
i
persisted
and
she
uh
she
admitted
that
i
had
had
a
cat
scan
when
i
was
six
years
old
something
like
that
and
i
asked
her
why
i'd
had
a
cat
scan
and
she
didn't
wanna
talk
about
it
but
she
started
laughing
a
little
bit
and
uh
which
is
weird
from
where
i
was
standing
you
know
kind
of
filled
with
dread
and
having
like
this
like
repressed
memory
come
up
uh
and
uh
finally
she
admitted
i
had
had
a
cat
scan
and
she
told
me
why
she
said
that
i
was
um
so
slow
that
they
thought
that
i
was
retarded
and
i
had
been
given
a
battery
of
tests
to
test
my
cognitive
ability
and
the
tests
were
inconclusive
and
they
couldn't
figure
out
the
jury's
still
out
trust
me
um
but
uh
the
tests
were
inconclusive
so
they
thought
that
maybe
i
just
had
a
brain
tumor
and
uh
so
they
were
gon
they
that's
why
i
got
the
cat
scan
i
don't
know
if
you're
ever
had
one
but
uh
i
don't
even
like
giving
blood
for
a
for
a
blood
test
i
don't
i
this
is
actually
thinking
about
it
right
now
probably
exactly
why
i
hate
western
medicine
entirely
and
will
do
anything
to
stay
away
from
a
doctor
um
well
a
cat
scan
they
have
to
like
take
your
clothes
off
if
and
uh
if
you're
little
and
you
don't
wanna
take
your
clothes
off
in
a
room
full
of
strangers
and
then
they
this
my
memory
is
so
i
don't
know
i
guess
they
inject
something
into
your
ankle
like
an
iodine
solution
and
then
you
they
lay
you
on
a
table
and
you
get
slid
into
a
tube
that
sends
whatever
rays
through
your
body
to
look
into
your
brain
to
see
what's
going
on
um
totally
fucking
terrifying
like
uh
i
remembered
trying
to
escape
i
remembered
screaming
until
i
was
hoarse
i
remembered
uh
my
father
coming
into
the
room
and
talking
me
down
i
remember
having
my
clothes
put
back
on
and
taken
to
the
gift
shop
and
my
father
bought
me
a
book
of
animal
limericks
and
and
rhymes
and
photographs
of
the
animals
all
these
animals
from
north
america
black
hard
covered
book
i
remembered
that
book
and
i
had
it
through
childhood
but
i
didn't
remember
anything
about
the
cat
scan
after
i
left
the
hospital
cause
that
it
sucked
that
bad
um
my
parents
loved
love
love
me
love
their
children
uh
and
uh
that
couldn't
have
been
anything
but
painful
and
frightening
for
my
father
too
you
know
the
whole
situation
um
and
i
i
so
i'm
just
thinking
about
what
motivated
them
to
go
to
that
extreme
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
me
okay
so
it
turns
out
that
no
brain
tumor
as
a
child
just
slow
i'm
just
slow
i
have
figured
out
ways
to
live
my
life
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
as
far
as
survival
is
concerned
and
actually
i've
been
able
to
thrive
you
know
by
degrees
and
and
uh
i
i
had
to
think
about
that
so
tempted
to
sing
so
tempted
to
push
it
so
past
the
time
that
she
starts
playing
and
i
have
to
improvise
a
song
on
top
of
it
to
finish
the
story
i
won't
do
that
um
just
thinking
about
um
not
doing
that
to
my
child
you
know
having
the
f
the
having
the
good
fortune
to
have
a
child
that's
so
much
like
me
that
i
can
take
my
experiences
and
and
help
her
at
least
in
this
moment
i
don't
know
what
the
future
holds
and
i
don't
know
who
she's
going
to
become
you
know
but
uh
i
can
use
my
experience
in
a
way
to
to
lessen
her
her
potential
problems
in
this
world
which
is
what
you
ultimately
ultimately
ultimately
wish
for
as
a
parent
um
her
mother
went
to
talk
to
the
teacher
a
couple
weeks
later
and
came
back
horrified
and
wanted
to
but
she's
not
a
violent
person
but
she
she
wanted
she
wanted
our
daughter
out
too
so
we
took
our
daughter
out
of
that
school
she's
now
at
a
steiner
school
which
really
suits
her
much
better
and
uh
we're
both
slow
