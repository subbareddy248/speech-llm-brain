so
i
get
a
phone
call
from
my
mom
and
she
tells
me
that
my
father
is
about
to
get
on
an
emergency
life
flight
from
our
home
in
montana
to
go
to
denver
to
get
an
emergency
liver
transplant
my
mom
is
kinda
perennially
optimistic
and
she's
telling
me
don't
worry
it's
gonna
be
ok
we're
gonna
pull
through
this
it's
gonna
be
alright
but
i
know
something
is
is
really
wrong
so
i
get
the
next
flight
i
can
to
go
from
where
i'm
living
here
in
new
york
hoping
that
i
get
there
before
my
father
dies
and
i'm
really
glad
i
i
got
that
flight
as
fast
as
i
did
because
i
was
able
to
spend
a
couple
hours
with
my
father
before
he
passed
away
and
before
i
know
it
i'm
at
this
side
of
his
hospital
bed
with
my
mom
and
we're
sobbing
because
he's
passed
um
my
dad
was
a
he
was
a
strong
silent
type
he
was
um
he
was
a
grew
up
on
a
farm
and
he
was
the
town
one
of
one
of
two
town
eye
doctors
so
he
could
fix
anything
you
know
he
could
fix
tractors
or
eyes
he
could
you
know
no
matter
what
and
he
was
always
doing
it
like
behind
the
scenes
you
know
he
never
wanted
to
take
credit
for
it
um
it
was
apparent
that
my
mom
and
i
and
um
my
two
brothers
were
gonna
have
to
be
fixing
things
ourself
this
time
around
and
the
first
thing
my
mom
did
was
was
to
call
my
two
brothers
one's
a
year
older
one
is
a
year
younger
and
it
was
gonna
be
really
comforting
to
see
my
younger
brother
we
were
really
close
um
it
was
gonna
he
was
really
gonna
support
me
um
it
was
gonna
be
much
more
complicated
seeing
my
older
brother
um
we'd
always
had
a
a
really
complicated
relationship
and
there
was
something
really
big
about
me
that
he
did
not
know
and
that's
that
the
last
time
he
saw
me
um
years
and
years
before
i
was
male
he
was
not
aware
that
i
had
transitioned
from
being
male
to
being
female
and
you
know
i
always
wanted
to
to
tell
him
i
was
trying
to
find
the
right
time
the
right
place
trying
to
you
know
get
up
the
nerve
um
i
was
worried
about
his
reaction
maybe
that
you
know
he
was
a
bit
conservative
he
had
a
temper
i
didn't
know
how
it's
gonna
happen
and
i
just
kept
s
putting
it
off
and
um
never
found
the
right
time
and
here
we
are
at
the
time
where
i
have
to
deal
with
all
this
stuff
uh
marc
wasn't
the
only
one
who
didn't
know
my
story
my
whole
hometown
didn't
know
about
me
either
and
you
know
i
was
trying
to
find
a
way
to
tell
marc
i
just
kind
of
figured
with
my
hometown
i
just
i
just
would
never
go
back
there
again
so
my
mom
uh
calls
my
brother
and
in
one
phone
call
tells
him
that
he
lost
his
father
and
that
he
now
has
a
sister
um
and
i
have
to
say
i
mean
marc
was
he
was
really
great
um
he
he
got
off
the
plane
we
met
him
at
the
airport
he
gave
me
a
hug
um
but
it
was
awkward
as
you
can
imagine
and
you
know
i
think
we
did
what
a
lot
of
families
do
at
times
like
that
you
just
kind
of
fall
back
on
tradish
tradition
and
we
um
wanted
to
uh
do
something
that
my
mom
and
dad
had
always
done
every
year
um
because
you
see
it
was
my
father's
birthday
he
had
passed
away
twenty
minutes
before
um
before
his
his
sixty
fifth
birthday
so
we
all
went
to
applebee's
and
we
got
a
slice
of
sizzling
apple
pie
and
put
a
candle
in
it
and
my
brother
marc
who
really
worshipped
my
father
got
the
honor
of
of
blowing
out
the
candle
and
when
he
was
blowing
out
the
candle
i
re
i
still
remember
the
expression
on
his
face
he
was
you
know
trying
to
process
my
father's
passing
he
was
figuring
out
why
it
had
been
so
long
that
the
two
of
us
hadn't
talked
something
that
really
frustrated
him
and
um
it
was
just
all
kind
of
coming
together
i
i
took
a
business
card
out
of
my
purse
uh
it
was
for
this
job
that
marc
didn't
even
know
i
had
it
had
my
new
name
on
it
and
i
wrote
my
cell
phone
number
on
it
and
i
gave
it
to
marc
i
said
look
you
know
we
haven't
talked
for
so
long
but
here
any
time
any
place
no
barriers
call
me
any
t
we're
you
know
we
can
talk
anytime
you
want
and
my
mom
started
crying
because
her
you
know
her
her
children
were
reuniting
and
also
because
sh
you
know
for
years
she
had
been
running
interference
between
the
two
of
us
and
using
every
excuse
in
the
book
to
explain
why
i
wasn't
getting
back
to
him
or
why
you
know
packages
to
me
were
being
returned
because
they
had
the
wrong
name
on
them
and
it
you
know
her
job
running
interference
was
over
so
marc
was
in
shock
um
we
were
all
in
shock
i
was
i
was
in
shock
because
i
was
thinking
about
the
fact
that
you
know
nobody
in
my
hometown
knew
and
i'm
wondering
if
i
can
go
back
for
the
for
um
the
funeral
if
i
if
i
should
go
back
if
my
mom
and
and
my
brothers
really
want
me
to
really
deep
down
um
and
i'm
thinking
that
you
know
i
never
even
thought
that
i
was
gonna
go
back
to
my
hometown
and
now
i'm
being
i'm
being
pulled
back
right
into
it
as
contradictory
as
it
may
seem
as
soon
as
there
was
a
reason
to
go
back
i
had
this
really
deep
strong
yearning
to
go
back
i
mean
i
i
had
gone
to
school
in
new
york
and
san
francisco
and
travelled
all
over
the
world
and
this
place
that
i
thought
of
as
home
uh
that
i
think
i
really
repressed
knowing
that
i
couldn't
go
back
there
right
i
don't
i
don't
need
to
go
back
there
but
as
soon
as
there
was
a
reason
for
me
to
go
back
there
very
strong
reason
i
really
really
wanted
to
go
i
wanted
to
see
the
house
the
only
house
i
had
ever
known
growing
up
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
my
hometown
and
these
people
that
you
know
comprise
this
community
that
i
thought
of
as
home
right
and
my
mom
um
reassured
me
that
she
she
wanted
me
to
be
there
that
she
in
fact
needed
me
there
for
support
my
brothers
too
and
my
mom
had
a
plan
to
get
us
there
you
know
our
our
family
had
been
separated
for
a
long
time
so
she
had
the
idea
for
all
of
us
to
rent
a
car
and
drive
the
twenty
hours
from
denver
back
to
montana
so
before
you
know
it
there
we
are
in
the
car
you
know
my
has
brother
hasn't
seen
me
for
years
especially
not
as
female
and
here
were
are
and
we
we
we
had
so
much
to
do
we
were
plan
we
were
planning
his
servi
my
my
father's
funeral
service
we
were
writing
his
obituary
my
mom
wanted
to
figure
out
and
i
did
too
wanted
to
figure
out
how
we
could
introduce
the
information
about
me
while
still
keeping
the
focus
on
my
father
so
she
had
me
driving
out
in
the
you
know
cross
wyoming
seventy
miles
an
hour
she
had
me
take
dictation
of
of
her
friends
and
she
wanted
to
invite
them
over
for
tea
so
she
had
this
really
strategic
list
it's
like
you
invite
judy
and
she's
gonna
tell
all
the
people
in
the
arts
community
that
my
mom
was
involved
in
and
you're
gonna
tell
june
and
june
is
gonna
tell
all
the
people
at
dad's
office
and
we'll
find
somebody
else
in
the
she's
gonna
tell
everybody
uh
at
the
church
and
the
next
night
there
they
were
eighteen
of
my
mom's
best
friends
uh
and
the
minister
from
the
church
where
the
service
was
was
gonna
be
performed
they're
drinking
tea
my
mom
says
you
all
know
very
well
by
now
that
i've
lost
my
husband
and
i
know
a
lot
of
you
have
wondered
what
happened
to
my
middle
son
who
seemed
to
disappear
and
um
she
said
i
want
you
to
know
tonight
that
i
i
have
a
daughter
and
her
name
is
kim
and
this
is
my
child
and
i
love
my
child
and
i
hope
you
do
too
and
we
can
focus
on
this
tonight
we
can
talk
about
this
tonight
um
you
all
are
my
ambassadors
if
someone
has
questions
at
the
funeral
and
i'm
caught
up
in
things
i
want
i'm
going
to
point
them
to
you
and
let
you
tell
this
story
because
you
can
talk
about
it
in
a
sensitive
way
and
she
um
you
know
took
a
couple
a
couple
questions
from
the
people
there
and
the
whole
tea
party
ended
slightly
different
than
the
tea
party
we
hear
about
in
the
news
uh
the
whole
thing
ended
with
everybody
raising
their
teacups
and
saying
hip
hip
hurray
for
kim
hip
hip
hurray
for
kim
there
were
a
couple
amens
and
some
applause
and
and
then
everybody
went
home
and
i
swear
there
was
a
brownout
from
all
the
simultaneous
phone
calls
that
were
being
made
dispensing
the
information
right
so
then
the
next
night
there
was
a
viewing
f
of
of
my
father's
body
at
the
at
the
funeral
home
and
i
had
elected
not
to
go
because
you
know
i
didn't
want
the
focus
to
be
on
me
i
was
gonna
keep
it
on
everybody
keep
it
on
my
father
um
but
my
best
friend
tim
from
high
school
was
at
the
viewing
and
he
calls
me
up
um
he
had
only
known
the
new
me
for
a
couple
days
i
hadn't
even
told
him
uh
but
he
knew
me
really
well
and
he
knew
i
was
chickening
out
and
he
called
me
from
the
the
the
funeral
parlor
and
he
said
hey
gotta
lot
of
people
here
that
really
want
to
see
you
um
i
should
probably
tell
you
that
the
people
he's
talking
about
are
the
football
team
um
cause
i
used
to
be
on
the
football
team
and
so
applause
for
that
eh
um
and
so
tim
says
where
are
you
i
gotta
lot
of
people
who
want
to
see
you
i'm
like
yeah
i
don't
want
to
go
and
you
know
i
want
to
keep
the
focus
on
my
dad
i
don't
want
to
be
the
and
he's
like
yeah
yeah
whatever
either
you
come
down
here
or
we're
gonna
come
up
there
what's
it
gonna
be
i
said
i've
i
sh
i
come
up
here
i
guess
so
before
i
know
it
the
football
team
is
at
my
front
door
and
couple
of
em
have
cases
of
beer
under
their
arm
one
case
gets
tossed
in
the
snow
bank
to
keep
it
cold
it's
just
like
high
school
and
all
of
a
sudden
they're
in
my
living
room
and
it's
this
wake
instantly
and
a
show
of
support
for
me
and
for
the
memory
of
my
father
right
and
they're
in
my
living
room
this
living
room
i
never
even
thought
i
would
see
again
and
people
were
either
laughing
or
crying
mostly
laughing
um
and
i
remember
looking
around
the
room
and
there
there's
there's
kevin
he
was
one
of
the
co
captains
of
the
football
team
with
me
and
i
look
over
there
and
there's
my
brothers
marc
and
todd
and
they
were
you
know
we
were
all
very
close
in
age
so
we
sh
had
friends
in
common
and
they're
telling
stories
about
my
dad
and
there's
um
i
look
ah
um
i
look
over
on
the
couch
and
there's
frank
ah
sh
probably
should
have
ald
you
a
also
told
you
that
um
not
only
was
i
on
the
football
team
but
i
was
the
quarterback
um
and
so
i
look
over
on
the
couch
and
there's
frank
he's
an
offensive
lineman
it's
the
job
of
an
offensive
lineman
to
protect
the
quarterback
and
frank
is
protecting
me
once
again
twenty
years
later
under
very
different
circumstances
and
he's
got
his
arm
around
my
girlfriend
they're
laughing
and
knocking
back
cans
of
cheap
beer
and
that
was
the
moment
that
i
knew
things
were
gonna
be
ok
somehow
and
there
was
one
more
person
there
that
night
and
that
was
my
mom
and
she
told
me
something
that
we
ended
up
repeating
quite
a
bit
that
weekend
uh
through
the
services
um
she
came
up
and
she
said
you
know
dad
was
always
fixing
things
and
it
looks
like
he
fixed
this
too
she
said
you
know
even
though
your
father
has
died
you've
been
reborn
thank
you
very
much
