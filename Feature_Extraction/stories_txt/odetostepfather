under
the
influence
is
our
topic
tonight
and
uh
i
i
thought
of
a
lot
of
different
things
and
and
the
one
i
kinda
wanted
to
talk
about
was
my
secret
influence
um
there
are
people
in
our
lives
that
are
incredibly
important
to
us
and
i
would
even
m
mention
to
say
some
of
the
most
important
people
everybody
aside
from
my
mother
in
my
life
doesn't
know
anything
about
this
person
who
i
think
about
every
day
and
his
name
was
michael
marquis
so
if
this
were
a
violin
piece
it
would
be
called
ode
to
michael
marquis
um
i
met
him
when
i
was
seven
years
old
and
i
was
growing
up
uh
my
mother
had
left
my
father
when
i
was
about
two
or
three
and
this
was
the
first
man
that
my
mother
had
brought
home
like
for
me
to
meet
and
uh
he
was
a
vietnam
vet

was
a
professional
athlete
ah

had
played
college

baseball
he
was
uh
a
ski
instructor
and

had
this
unbelievable
m
g
and
not
like
those
little
like
wussy
m
g
s
that
you
see
like
it
was
like
a
nineteen
thirty
three
m
g
it
was
like
a
motorcycle
i
mean
this
thing
was
so
cool
and
the
doors
like
went
super
low

i
mean
it
was
just
so
cool
and
he
was
so
cool
and
he
was
the
first
person
to
really
tap
into
um
he
may
have
tapped
into
it
he
may
have
created
it
i'm
not
sure
but
a
momma's
boy
complex
um
which
was
that
i
had
uh
i
hadn't
been
my
my
father
lived
in
texas
and
i
hadn't
been
to
texas
since
i
was
about
three
but
i
was
obsessed
i
had
a
dallas
cowboys
belt
buckle
i
would
wear
like
you
know
um
uh
flower
t
shirts
you
know
like
grant
parson's
or
something
like
that
i
mean
it's
just
about
nineteen
seventy
seven
i
was
very
into
that
i
only
listened
to
willy
nelson's
the
red
headed
stranger
um
my
room
was
covered
with
cowboys
and
broncos
and
indians
and
like
anything
texas
was
up
my
alley
and
he
met
me
and
he's
like
why
what's
all
the
texas
stuff
you
know
i
was
like
well

dad
lives
in
texas

well
he
ain't
here
is
he
i'm
like
n

like
well
i
think
i'd
get
over
the
texas
thing
if
i
were
you
i'd
be
like
you
know
that
really
hurt
my
feelings
and
and
he
he
proceeded
to
like
latch
into
this
thing
like
so
what
you
a
momma's
boy
cowboys
lost
today
did
your
dad
call
no
right
he's
he's
very
tough
guy
very
tough
guy
um
and
and
through
uh
a
little
bit
of
what
what
my
mother
felt
was
kind
of
abusive
behavior
um
uh
uh
i
i
grew
to
love
him
right
i
mean
i
hated
him
but
i
loved
him
i
i
i
i
thought
about
him
all
the
time
and
what
he
would
think
about
something
and
and
like
uh
for
example
he
decided
that
uh
since
i
was
so
into
football
uh
but
you
don't
know
how
to
play
football
you
know
what
name
know
any
did
your
dad
teach
you
to
play
football

i
don't
think
he
did
did
he
alright

on
let's
play
football
no
it's
uh
i'm
not
looking
for
the
pity
thing
it's
pretty
funny
i
mean
he
was
a
funny
guy
he
he
was
trying
to
help
me
in
his
own
weird
way
so
he
takes
me
outside
he
takes
me
outside
and
he
uh
he
says
uh
alright
i'm
gonna
teach
you
how
to
play
football
alright
but
football
is
a
man's
game
it's
not
a
momma's
boy's
game
{cg}
alright
you
put
you
you
make
a
diamond
with
your
hands
your
thumb
to
your
forefingers
and
if
you
can
touch
it
you
can
catch
it
so
i'm
like
alright
bam
you
know
and
i'm
he's
like
you
still
with
me
you
still
wanna
play
football
huh
i'm
like
yeah
i
wanna
play
football
he's
like
alright
if
you
can
touch
it
you
can
catch
it
bam
you
know
and
it
this
this
went
on
i
mean
and
and
too
was
freezing
outside
and
um
and
my
nose
is
bleeding
and
um
i'm
crying
and
i
want
to
go
inside
and
he's
like
you
know
you
gotta
catch
this
football
alright
and
so
finally
i
catch
it
like
three
times
he's
like
alright
see
you're
not
such
a
little
momma's
boy
after
all
and
i
feel
kinda
good
about
myself
i
mean
you
know
i
mean
go
figure
you
know
so
my
mom
really
liked
him
and
um
we
moved
to
vermont
and
he
took
us
and
he
moved
us
into
this
one
bedroom
one
no
it
was
just
a
one
room
cabin
in
vermont
where
uh
s
he
had
this
gig
uh
as
a
ski
instructor
and
um
and
it
was
really
picturesque
and
he
really
had
it
in
his
heart
like
uh
to
teach
me
how
to
be
a
man
you
know
and
we
would
he
taught
me
how
to
chop
wood
and
he
bought
me
um
a
jeans
jacket
and
he
would
have
my
mom
do
like
patches
on
the
back
you
know
and
it
was
really
very
cool
and
i
started
to
feel
very
cool
he
he
took
me
to
see
um
the
man
who
would
be
king
um
and
uh
you
know
i
cr
i
cried
at
the
end
which
is
ah
this
is
a
digression
i'm
going
to
regret
doing
this
but
but
it's
my
favorite
line
and
since
i
have
an
audience
i
have
to
tell
you
it's
it's
like
sean
connery
is
standing
on
the
burning
bridge
and
and
michael
cain
is
shot
he's
the
bridge
is
burning
he's
gonna
die
and
michael
cain
scrouts
out
you
know
peachy
will
you
ever
forgive
me
for
being
so
bleedin
stupid
and
so
bloody
arrogant
and
sean
connery
says
you
know
that
i
can
and
that
i
do
so
like
michael
and
i
sat
there
and
i
just
cried
and
he
was
just
like
pull
yourself
together
man
you
know
we
got
in
the
car
he
got
his
little
m
g
and
it's
like
freezing
and
i'm
crying
and
he's
like
come
on
it
was
a
good
movie
it
was
sad
but
it
was
you
know
you
gotta
you
know
i
loved
it
too
i
loved
it
too
but
like
from
then
on
in
my
mind
like
michael
and
i
were
you
know
michael
cain
and
sean
connery
and
on
adventures
and
things
and
we
we
had
them
you
know
i
mean
i
i
had
to
walk
i
mean
it's
really
kinda
picturesque
i
had
to
walk
like
two
miles
to
school
and
i
was
only
in
second
grade
and
it
was
very
fun
he
insisted
that
i
do
it
you
know
by
myself
and
my
my
mother
had
s
a
lotta
problems
with
like
the
the
the
you
like
my
when
my
mother
would
go
she
had
to
go
outa
town
a
couple
times
and
he
would
take
me
on
dates
with
other
women
and
like
if
you
tell
your
mother
i'm
gonna
kick
your
ass
and
uh
but
i
thought
it
was
great
i
mean
again
like
you
keep
being
judgmental
and
i
i
was
like
i
was
like
this
guy
is
so
cool
and
um
i
remember
i
like
rolled
uh
joints
for
him
for
this
other
girl
i
don't
know
i
i
i
have
this
vague
memory
of
it
but
um
uh
and
finally
like
my
most
pivotal
memory
of
him
aside
from
the
closing
of
my
story
uh
is
uh
is
we
had
you
know
this
little
one
room
cabin
i
mean
it
was
really
really
uh
idyllic
snow
in
vermont
and
all
this
other
stuff
and
and
and
michael
we're
out
on
this
little
deck
outside
of
it
and
michael's
like
see
that
look
at
that
buck
look
at
that
buck
ok
get
the
shotgun
ethan

get
the
shotgun
you
know
and
i'm
i'm
like
i'm
like

what
for
he's
like
i'm
gonna
kill
it
and
i'm
like
i'm
like
i'm
like
mom
michael's
gonna
kill
a
buck
michael's
gonna
kill
a
buck
michael
goes
hell
i
was
gonna
let
you
shoot
it
you
blew
it
you
know
and
i
didn't
know
how
i
felt
cause
i
didn't
wanna
shoot
it
but
now
i
felt
like
i
should
have
wanted
to
shoot
it
and
like
i
don't
know
i
felt
very
strange
doesn't
exactly
make
sense
but
you
can
understand
the
subconscious
very
influenced
um
and
so
finally
one
day
i
come
walking
home
from
school
this
little
cabin
and
all
my
mother's
underwear
and
lingerie
kinda
like
things
are
nailed
to
the
outside
of
the
house
right
this
is
a
true
story
alright
and
i'm
like
wow
that's
weird
you
know

and

and
and
uh
and
inside
there's
like
ra
ra
ra
ra
ra
ra
ra
you
know
ba
ba
and
um
uh
you
know
we
basically
get
in
the
car
and
we're
gone
and
uh
we
move
to
atlanta
georgia
and
um
you
know
i
don't
know
any
more
about
what
happened
there
than
you
do
i
mean
lingerie
fighting
i
don't
i
can
guess
you
know
but
i've
never
asked
my
mom
my
mom
has
a
lot
of
issues
but
that's
not
this
is
michael's
ode
um
and
so
anyway
we
move
to
atlanta
georgia
and
what
happens
is
my
father
uh
gets
remarried
and
for
some
reason
to
my
now
eight
year
old
mind
this
is
very
disturbing
um
i'm
not
invited
to
the
wedding
and
i'm
very
upset
about
this
and
and
it
it
it's
kind
of
throwing
my
whole
texas
fantasy
scheme
a
a
a
apart
and
i
get
uh
but
i'm
ih
i'm
in
this
like
weird
school
in
atlanta
georgia
and
i
actually
get
accepted
to
this
a
this
um
little
gifted
and
talented
program
like
for
an
eight
year
old
right
and
i
i
go
to
and
i
get
kicked
out
on
the
second
day
cause
i
telled
some
told
some
kid
that
his
painting
sucked
right
or
the
teacher
uh
uh
i
didn't
get
kicked
out
right
away
uh
uh
i
had
to
write
a
one
page
essay
about
why
um
i
would
you
know
about
w
i
was
supposed
to
write
about
why
saying
somebody's
painting
sucked
was
a
bad
thing
and
i
wrote
in
my
essay
that
i
didn't
know
that
it
was
something
bad
because
my
mother
goes
out
with
lots
of
guys
and
the
last
one
that
she
dated
told
me
i
sucked
all
the
time
and
i
didn't
think
it
was
that
big
a
deal
now
that
that
that
sounds
like
the
truth
is
i
knew
exactly
what
i
was
doing
like
and
it
wasn't
like
it
i
was
trying
to
make
my
mom
look
bad
in
front
of
the
teachers
to
like
deflect
um
y
you
know
me
being
in
trouble
i
my
mom
was
so
angry
at
me
she
hon
like
like
she
got
this
call
from
the
teacher
and
she
hangs
up
yeah
yeah
yeah
you
little
shit
you
you
know
uh
i
don't
date
lots
of
guys
and
michael
didn't
say
you
sucked
yes
he
did
alright
he
did
but
you
know
like
bla
bla
and
um
anyway
the
point
is
and
then
i
got
in
a
fight
and
i
got
kicked
out
of
this
gifted
and
talented
thing
and
it
was
like
a
big
deal
and
my
father's
getting
remarried
and
they
sent
me
to
a
child
psychologist
and
and
my
mom
comes
up
with
this

so
my
birthday
arrives
and
we're
living
in

with
the
golden
retriever

a
bunch
of
presents
in

really
being
really
nice
i

so
so
and

like
i
watch
him
drive
away
it's

never
gonna
speak
to
you
again
you

i
i
i
i
felt
so
betrayed
by
her
because
if
michael
was
gonna
leave
i
wanted
him
to
think
i
didn't

and
i
never
saw
him
again

got
a
message
my
mother
got
a
message
about
two
or
three
years
ago
or
something
that
uh
that
uh
she
googled
michael
marquis
no
she
didn't
um
uh
that
uh
she
she
had
heard
from
him
and
that
like
he
saw
some
movie
i
did
and
thought
that
i
was
doing
really
great
and
really
meant
a
lot
to
me
because
uh
you
know
nobody
i
know
knows
him
but
i
carry
him
with
me
every
day
and
uh
he's
been
the
secret
influence
of
my
life
thank
you
